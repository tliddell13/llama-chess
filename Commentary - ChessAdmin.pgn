not to block the Bg2 and normally looks to move the knight to f4.} 6...e6 {an

1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 e6 4.e3 f5 5.Bd3 Nf6 6.O-O Bd6 7.b3 {Unlike in the round 2
game, White goes for a more standard plan against the Stonewall. The text move
prepares Ba3 and an exchange of the Bd6, which would leave Black with a weak
dark-square complex. Black's next move is designed to prevent this.} 7...Qe7 
8.Qc2 O-O 9.Ne5 {there is a wide variety of moves played here, but occupying e5
with a knight is a standard idea for White.} 9...b6 10.Bb2 {a reasonable move
but a new one nonetheless, according to the database.} 10...Bb7 {this
development of the light-square bishop is a feature of the Modern Stonewall and
is now more popular than the old transfer of the bishop to h5. On b7, the bishop
appears buried, but serves a useful function supporting the c-pawn and can
spring to life if it advances and pawn exchanges occur in the center.} 11.cxd5

preserves the valuable bishop.} 15.Qe2 c5 {now the Bb7 looks quite strong.} 
16.Nxd7 {exchanging the nicely posted Ne5 for the Nd7 seems counterintuitive,
but is in fact a common idea in the Stonewall, in part because White can
reposition her other knight to e5 later on. White starts to have problems in
this position if this does not occur, as examined in the following sample
variation. Black has a number of tactical possibilities lurking, with ideas
including using her Nd5 for forks on c3 or f4, along with the two powerful
bishops pointed at White's king.} ( 16.Rad1 cxd4 17.Bxd4 {recapturing with the

1.Nf3 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 {instead of playing d4 and heading for a standard queen
pawn opening, White switches to an English continuation.} 3...Bb4 {the
Nimzo-English.} 4.Qc2 {unlike the Nimzo-Indian, where the text move is merely
one option among several major lines, White overwhelmingly chooses Qc2 (and
sometimes Qb3) in the English, to preserve his pawn structure after Bxc3; g3 is
the one popular alternative to this approach.} 4...O-O 5.a3 Bxc3 {otherwise the
bishop move has simply been a loss of time.} 6.Qxc3 b6 7.e3 Bb7 8.b3 {White has
a choice in this line between playing b3 or b4; one or the other will be
necessary to develop with Bb2. The text move is the more solid way to play, with
b4 grabbing a little more space.} 8...d6 9.Bb2 Nbd7 10.Be2 Nc5 {one of the
differences between this line and the b4 line is that Black has c5 available for
the knight, even if only temporarily.} 11.d4 Nce4 {the e4 square is normally key
in the Nimzo and Black takes advantage of her dominance of it.} 12.Qc2 c5

king before initiating action in the center.} 13...Rc8 {the opening phase is
over and both sides need to come up with their middlegame plans here.} 14.Rad1 
{White's choice of which rook to move indicates that she is more interested in
central and kingside play than in the queenside.} 14...Qe7 15.dxc5 Rxc5 {this is
a somewhat unusual choice for recapturing, but Black apparently wanted to avoid
the below variation. The rook move perhaps would be better justified if Black
could swing her rook over to the kingside.} ( 15...Nxc5 {and now} 16.Bxf6 gxf6 
( 16...Qxf6 17.Rxd6 ) 17.Nd2 f5 {is evaluated as equal by Houdini. Human players
would of course dislike to see their pawn structure compromised, but in this

kingside.} ) 16.b4 ( 16.Nd2 {is Houdini's preference, with the aim of getting
rid of the Ne4.} ) 16...Rcc8 17.Qb3 {with tactical threats nonexistent, the
middlegame enters a maneuvering phase. This is similar to what normally occurs
in the Hedgehog and the position shares some characteristics of that.}

18...e5 19.Bb2 {the d6/e5 pawn formation is now weaker and less flexible than
the d6/e6 pawn center, especially with the backwards d6 pawn on the half-open
file. It is currently well-guarded, but in the long run that could be a
weakness. The e5 advance more importantly for the shorter term also creates a
hole on d5 which White, if she can, will try to exploit.} 19...Qe6 {Black
recognizes the weakness of d5 and moves to reassert control over it, also
putting the queen in an excellent central location on the a2-g8 and h3-c8
diagonals.} 20.Rc1 b5 {attempting to force the issue of the fate of the
queenside pawns, taking advantage of the pin against the Qb3.} 21.Qd3 {the only
good response.} 21...bxc4 22.Rxc4 Bd5 {further exchanges on c4 are not in
Black's interest, as her structural weakness at d6 would become much more
evident with fewer pieces on the board.} 23.Rcc1 ( 23.Rxc8 Rxc8 24.Rc1 Rxc1+

White does not have a good way to take advantage of the open c-file or increase
pressure down the d-file.} ) 23...Rb8 24.Qa6 {While the position is still equal,
White starts to pick up a slight initiative by making threats Black needs to
respond to. The 2-to-1 majority on the queenside and the open c-file are things
White can use to try for an eventual advantage, as well as the half-open
d-file.} 24...Rb7 25.h3 {apparently intended to prevent ...Ng4 before moving the
rook, but Houdini points out a tactical way for White to refute that.} (

surprisingly the queen has no squares.} ) 25...Qe7 {Black starts to face
difficulties in an increasingly complex and tactical position. Here she retreats
her queen to a much less active square.} ( 25...Rdb8 {is Houdini's suggestion as
an alternate method of overprotecting the Rb7, necessary to allow the Bd5
mobility.} ) 26.Rfd1 {it's worth observing how White's rooks and other pieces
are working together and are well-placed to apply further pressure, while
Black's more scattered and less cohesive pieces that are more oriented towards
defense.} 26...Bb3 {Houdini flags this as Black's first major error, given the
tactic available on move 29.} ( 26...Rbd7 ) 27.Rd3 Rb6 28.Qa5 Be6 29.Nd2 (

White's c5 pawn is isolated and weak.} 33...Rdb8 $6 {this lets White off the

very drawish opening. It can be, but usually only if both players are happy with
a draw.} 3...cxd5 4.Nf3 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 {varying with ...a6 or ...Qb6 here would
be one way to go for a more unbalanced position.} 6.Bf4 Nh5 {the classic
treatment of the variation is to keep symmetry with ...Bf5. The text move in
fact scores over 50 percent in the database.} 7.Bd2 {the usual choice, White
chooses a safe path for the bishop, implicitly arguing that while the Bd2 isn't
on a great square, the Nh5 is on a worse one.} 7...e6 {indicating that Black is
looking for an unbalanced game.} ( 7...Nf6 {is the drawing line, if Black is
willing to accept that outcome. White is faced with the choice of continuing
play with his bishop on d2, moving it to another substandard square, or
repeating moves.} ) 8.e3 Bd6 9.Ne5 g6 {only a handful of games are in the
database, but this scores 70 percent for White. Weakening the dark-square
complex like this looks strange, but White is not in a position to take
advantage of it, with his relevant bishop locked in. It also allows the
possibility of Nh5-g7-f5 at some point.} ( 9...Nf6 {is the other main choice,
which scores better for Black overall, although not in the following high-level
example, also a long endgame win fo White.} 10.f4 O-O 11.Bd3 Ne7 12.O-O b6

the opening but in a relatively unbalanced position which may give him chances
to pursue a win.} 13.Nc3 Bd6 {this appears to lose Black time and give White
some initiative.} ( 13...Nxe5 {seems logical here, getting rid of the strong
Ne5, which is an analagous theme in the Stonewall.} ) 14.f4 {now exchanging on

favorable exchange for Black.} 26.dxe5 Be8 27.Rfd2 Bd7 ( 27...g5 {is what the
aggressive engine recommends. Black in fact has a structure similar to a Dutch
Stonewall, with the potential for a well-supported pawn advance on the

has different ideas in mind for his bishops.} ) 29.Rc2 {inviting Black's next
move.} 29...Ba4 30.b3 Bb5 31.Qf3 Bb4 {this sets off a sequence of complex

taken.} 35...Rc1 36.Nxc8 {finally!} 36...Rxc8 {after the dust settles, Houdini
considers the position as equal. With only the c-file open and more or less
equivalent minor pieces, that seems reasonable.} 37.g4 hxg4 38.hxg4 {White has
opened the h-file, which he perhaps has a better chance to exploit, as well as
clearing some more light squares for his bishop.} 38...Qa3 39.Qe2 Kg8 40.Kg2

bishop with a pin.} 6...Bg4 7.Be2 e6 8.O-O Bd6 {instead of the ...Qc7 played in

out well for him.} ( 15.Be3 {seems solid.} ) 15...f5 {a key move idea in this
variation (also played earlier on in the Smyslov game given above). The diagonal
is opened up for Black's queen and the doubled pawn is used to grab space in
White's territory.} 16.Qxh7 Nf6 {Black uses the pawn sacrifice to activate his
pieces, moving his knight into the game and also making the Bd6 a much more
powerful piece with the h-file now open for attacking purposes (targeting the h2
pawn).} 17.Qh3 Ng4 18.g3 {this cuts off the Black bishop, but causes additional

fianchetto line versus the Slav is generally ineffective.} 7...Qc8 {a rather
passive development for the queen.} ( 7...Qb6 {is the most popular and should be
the easiest road to equality. Exchanging queens on b6 would be fine for Black,
as he then would get the half-open a-file and the doubled b-pawns are not in
fact weak.} ) 8.Nc3 dxc4 {a novelty in the database. Black normally continues to
maintain the tension in the center and have the extra control over e4. The text
move leads to a looser continuation by Black which is more aggressive and
unbalanced.} ( 8...h6 {is the most played here.} ) 9.Qxc4 b5 10.Qb3 b4 {the
logical follow-up. Now that Black has chosen this aggressive line which also
weakens his queenside, he needs to keep hitting White's pieces to disrupt his
opponent and keep him off-balance.} 11.Na4 ( 11.Nb1 {is an alternative, looking

opening.} 3...dxc4 4.e3 b5 5.a4 b4 6.Nce2 {this and Ne4 (the most played in the

retreats to a2 and b1 are likely to transpose to variations from the mainline

ignored by popular theory.} 7.Be2 ( 7.d5 {is the typical reaction against the
Nc6 setup and why many Black players avoid the knight move, since it can be

played (and also the most theoretical).} 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5 5.Ng3 Bg6 6.h4 
{Spassky introduced this move into top-level play and made it the standard. It
is an aggressive pawn thrust, but it makes perfect sense in the context of the
bishop's location and White's natural orientation to kingside play in this
variation.} 6...h6 7.Nf3 e6 {a rare move, although Anand himself has played
this, along with the main line ...Nd7 and the alternative ...Nf6. The main line
prevents Ne5 by allowing Black to immediately exchange off the knight, so the
game continuation is the natural reaction.} 8.Ne5 Bh7 {no other square is safe
for the bishop.} 9.Bd3 {exchanging off the bishop is the most popular, also
logical from the standpoint of gaining time, as Black's bishop has made more
moves than White's equivalent and White will be left with more pieces developed
afterwards. Other commentators have also pointed out that Black's attempt to
snatch a pawn with ...Qxd4 fails to 10. Nxf7!} 9...Bxd3 10.Qxd3 Nd7 {this knight
needs to be developed sooner or later and challenging Black's Ne5 sooner is
certainly a good idea.} 11.f4 {this is by far the most popular move, although by
no means forced. If White is going to play aggressively with 8. Ne5, then this
continuation makes sense to keep the space advantage on the kingside. With this
move, however, White is essentially committing himself to castle queenside, as
the kingside pawn shield is now almost nonexistent. (See move 14 notes, however,
for a game featuring Anand castling kingside)} 11...Bb4+ {a typical idea in the
Caro-Kann, provoking the c-pawn advance and weakening the future home of the
White king.} 12.c3 Be7 13.Bd2 Ngf6 14.O-O-O {this is an interesting choice. In

capture and following up with 6. c3, which however is not the most aggressive

fianchettoing the bishop.} 4...Nf6 5.d4 O-O 6.Be2 cxd4 7.Nxd4 d5 {Black's score

1.c4 Nf6 2.Nf3 e6 3.g3 d5 {the QGD setup against the English can result in a
number of different kinds of games. Here White is already committed to a
kingside fianchetto, rather than central play.} 4.Bg2 dxc4 {this scores the best
of Black's possibilities here, with around 52 percent for White. Completing the
QGD setup with ...Be7 is the most popular choice, however.} 5.Qa4+ {safely
recovering the pawn} 5...Nbd7 6.Qxc4 a6 7.Qb3 {an anticipatory retreat. White
from here scores close to 60 percent. This is a little more aggressive than the
other major option, Qc2.} 7...c5 {a more classical-type move.} ( 7...Rb8 {is the
better-scoring, more modern alternative. Black gets the rook off the long
diagonal and overprotects b7.} ) 8.d3 ( 8.a4 {immediately would be aimed at
restraining ...b5. White plays this a few moves later, however, as Black prefers
to focus on development rather than taking the opportunity to push the b-pawn in
the interim.} ) 8...Be7 {the bishop often is developed instead to d6 in this
line.} 9.Nc3 O-O 10.a4 Nb6 $146 {White has won the handful of previous games
with this position in the database, so perhaps Black trying something new is
warranted.} ( 10...Qc7 $5 {would pursue more standard development and makes
sense to support the c-pawn, as well as putting another piece in place to
influence the e5 square.} ) 11.O-O Nbd5 12.Ne5 $14 {White sensibly occupies the
now-undefended central square, heading for a more active location for the knight
on c4. This is the point of inflection for the game, as White takes over the
initiative and starts creating threats.} 12...Qc7 13.Nc4 Bd7 14.Nxd5 Nxd5

exchange sacrifice is recommended by Houdini (!) - not exactly a traditional
materialistic engine choice.} 17.Nxa8 Rxa8 18.Bf4 Qc6 {the point is that White

become dangerous in this open position without a White counterpart.} 18...Qxb6

deal of play left, the central pawn steamroller already looks like it spells

1.c4 e6 2.g3 d5 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Bg2 a6 {this is not one of those types of positions
where ...a6 will be inevitably played at some point, so throwing it in this
early appears artificial. White scores a healthy 60 percent from this position.} 
5.d4 {transposing to a Catalan where Black's previous move definitely looks
strange. However, the point is that White cannot automatically regain the pawn
after the capture on c4, as ...b5 is now possible.} 5...dxc4 6.O-O {it's
sometimes hard to remember that the Queen's Gambit is actually a gambit, but now
White is playing it as such.} 6...Nc6 7.Nbd2 {not the most promising-looking
move. Top players normally play e3 or Bg5.} 7...Nxd4 {although by no means
obligatory, this has been played in all 8 database games.} 8.Nxc4 {White has
indirectly exchanged the d and c pawns.} 8...Bc5 {Black plays to maintain the
central knight, rather than trade it off.} 9.Nfe5 {White in turn also foregoes
exchanging the Nd4, preferring to establish her own knight in the center.} 
9...O-O 10.Be3 {developing a piece and maintaining pressure in the center,
temporarily pinning the knight against the hanging Bc5. Interestingly, Houdini
already gives a small plus to White, meaning she has more than enough
compensation for the pawn.} 10...Ba7 {protecting the bishop in the best way,
although it still looks awkward.} 11.Rc1 $14 {What does White have for the pawn?
The Ne5 is excellently placed and cannot be easily driven off. The Nc4 is also
strong and can be routed to c6 if Black plays ...b5. White's Bg2 also looks
excellent, while its counterpart is doing nothing on c8 and will be a pain to
develop. Finally, the half-open c-file is already occupied by a White rook.} 
11...c5 {Black attempts to play as actively as possible and supports the d4
outpost.} 12.Bd2 {White judges that the bishop has no future on the g1-a7
diagonal and prepares to reroute it. This also clears the square for the e-pawn
to kick the Nd4.} 12...Nd5 {besides centralizing the knight, this blocks the
long diagonal and potentially will assist Black in developing the queenside.} 
13.e3 Nb5 14.Qe2 {while this develops the queen to a useful square, the main
effect is to clear d1 to develop the other rook.} 14...Nd6 {Black looks to start
some exchanges, in the hopes of trading away White's advantages.} 15.Rfd1 Nxc4

a freer game and the material advantage will start playing more of a role.} )

pawn structure there to something much less effective, while continuing her
central play.} ( 18...Nf6 $5 ) 19.Bxb4 cxb4 20.Ne5 ( 20.e5 Bb7 21.Bxb7 Qxb7

cramps Black, while her rooks look excellent and the knight is prepared to hop
into c6.} ) 20...Qg5 ( 20...Bb7 {it seems like finally getting this piece into
the game would be a good idea.} ) 21.Nc6 e5 {a useful move for Black that would
have been prevented by an earlier e5 on White's part.} 22.h4 {White pre-empts
potential activity by Black on the kingside and kicks the queen.} 22...Qf6 
23.b3 {White decides not to rush with the pawn capture on b4 (and in fact never
plays it).} 23...a5 $6 {playing a pawn move here essentially gives White a free
tempo and shows too great an attachment to the b4 pawn. The b5 pawn is immune to
capture because of the threat to f2, but White can immediately remedy that.} ( 
23...Be6 $11 ) 24.Rc2 Bb7 $2 {ironically the bishop finally develops, and it's
the losing move.} 25.Nxa7 Rxa7 26.Rc7 {the pin against the Ra7 and the fact that
the Bb7 is otherwise unprotected mean that White now has too many unanswerable
threats.} 26...Qb6 {this attempts to remedy the pin situation, but White can
powerfully double rooks on the 7th rank and Black cannot do anything about it.}

no avail.} 28.Kh2 {White puts safety first, getting the king out of the f-pawn
pin and off the back rank.} 28...h6 29.Qe3 Qa6 30.Qc5 {the queen now enters with
decisive threats.} 30...axb3 {again, more desperately, attempting to distract

center and develop the dark-squared bishop.} 4...cxd4 {exchanging the c for the
d pawn, which according to classical theory is a plus. Of course this is done
all the time in the Open Sicilian by White, so general ideas only get you so
far.} 5.exd4 b6 {again, the most popular continuation. The light-squared bishop
will otherwise be out of the game.} 6.h3 {a typical feature of the opening,

1.d4 f5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.O-O O-O 6.c3 {White apparently wants to
avoid a theoretical duel in the Leningrad variation, settling for an uncommon
solid-seeming move rather than the usual c4. The immediate logic is obvious, to
reinforce the d4 strongpoint, but the line is certainly less challenging to
Black. One difference that Black should keep in mind, though, is that White now
has Qb3+ without a pawn blocking the diagonal.} 6...a5 {Black cheekily answers
with an offbeat response of his own. This pawn move seeks to restrain White's
potential follow-up play on the queenside, including b4. Prior to this game,
however, it scored horribly, with no Black wins and White scoring a similar
number of wins and draws.} 7.Nbd2 {the natural square (c3) having been occupied,
White needs to take some extra time to get his knight developed. From here White
may also think about supporting the e4 advance.} 7...Nc6 {when Black can get
away with this knight development in the Leningrad, it's usually a good idea to
play it, since it fights directly for e5. The usual advance d5 here is not
playable for White, due to the c-pawn being a square short of its usual post.} 
8.Re1 d5 {a strong central reaction. Black sees that exerting control over e4
and c4 is more important than any potential resulting pawn structure
weaknesses.} 9.Nb3 {the knight has now taken two moves to get to a
not-very-useful square.} 9...Ne4 {another move Dutch players always love to be
able to execute unchallenged.} 10.a4 {otherwise Black threatens to push the
a-pawn and kick the hapless Nb3.} 10...e6 {the structure is now a hybrid of
Stonewall and Leningrad. However, the main point of the move was not the pawn
placement, but rather to open the diagonal and support Black's following move.} 
11.Bf4 g5 {yet another favorite move in the Dutch. Although Houdini still rates
the position as equal, the fact that Black has been able to consistently play
his desired thematic moves and take over the initiative this early is bad news
for White.} 12.Be5 Bh6 {Black chooses to avoid exchanging the Bg7 while also
preventing White from establishing a useful outpost on e5.} ( 12...Nxe5 13.Nxe5 
Qe7 $11 ) 13.Rf1 {it seems that White is already running out of good moves and
can do little in the face of Black's initiative.} 13...g4 $15 14.Ne1 Nxe5 {now
Black exchanges, with the knight out of the way.} 15.dxe5 {now the pawn on e5
will be a source of weakness for White.} 15...c5 {playing this without
preparation is possible for Black, although perhaps not the strongest
continuation.} ( 15...b6 {is favored by Houdini.} ) 16.Bxe4 dxe4 17.Nxc5 Qb6

file.} 19.Qb3 {White now attends to his weak b-pawn, but Black is able to
continue making threats and improving his pieces without impediment.} 19...Rd5

the b4 pawn against the unprotected Qb3.} 20.Qc4 $2 {unfortunately for White,
this just moves into another pin.} ( 20.Qb1 ) 20...Qc7 {attacking e5 again and
pinning the Nc5. White has no good way to meet all the Black threats.} 21.Nc2

some counterplay.} ( 21.Qa2 {withdrawing the queen helps, but is not sufficient
to get White out of danger in the rest of his position.} 21...axb4 22.cxb4 Rd2

counterplay, as the Rd5 would be hanging if Black recaptured with the e-pawn.}

choice.} ( 22...bxc5 {simply taking the piece, however, looks best.} 23.Nxf5

fine position.} ) 23.Nb5 Qe7 24.Nb3 $15 {White has managed to extricate himself
from the pin, with only a slightly worse game according to the engine, although
Black still looks threatening and the defender will have to walk a tightrope.

standard deployment to f5) is an interesting alternative. The bishop is harder
to exchange off for White and of course pins the knight. However, the bishop is
missed on the h7-b1 diagonal, where it is strong (and one of the reasons why
White normally immediately spends extra time in the opening to exchange it
off).} 5.Qb3 {immediately taking advantage of the bishop's absence from the
queenside.} 5...Qb6 {the strongest response. Black does not care if he ends up
with doubled b-pawns after a queen exchange, with a half-open a-file and the
extra pawn on b6 influencing the c5 square.} 6.Nc3 {White continues his
development and focuses on the action at the d5 square, rather than worrying
about the potential exchange on f3.} 6...e6 {as does Black.} ( 6...Bxf3 {it
would seem useful to inflict doubled f-pawns on White and weaken the kingside

logical follow-up for development.} 11...g5 {while this loosens Black's kingside

centralizing move that gets the queen in the game and also pressures the g5
pawn.} 30.Rxd8+ Bxd8 31.Rb1 a5 {this move gives White a chance to avoid the
threat to the h-pawn from a penetrating Black queen, but White either failed to

address it first.} 33.Kf1 Qh2 34.Ke2 Qe5+ 35.Kf1 Qh2 36.Ke2 {a repetition of the

something of a concession to White, as Black would prefer to be able to play e5,

bishop, as well as the more prosaic Nbd2.} 8...Qe8 $146 {the usual idea behind
this move in the Leningrad is to support an advance of the e-pawn, as well as
give the queen a path to the kingside after g6 is vacated.} ( 8...Nc6 $5

prospects on the g-file.} 18.Bf2 Be6 19.Qc2 Bd5 20.Nf3 Be4 {after this lengthy
bishop maneuver, Black has fully equalized and seems to have a clearer strategy
to follow on the kingside.} 21.Qd2 Ne7 {with the Be4 covering the diagonal, the

his "bad" bishop for one of Black's good knights, but this also will remove a
key dark-square defender from the game.} 22...Ng6 23.Bxf6 Rxf6 24.Rf2 c5 {this
move highlights one of the interesting things about the Dutch, in that Black has
to look at playing on all portions of the board to be most effective, and not
just fixate on the kingside. Black now threatens to push ...c4 and would welcome
the open d-file if the pawn were exchanged.} 25.Raf1 Qe6 26.a3 Rg8 $17 {Black
can now build up pressure rather easily on the kingside and center (g- and

the kingside. As we'll see later on, however, it never quite makes it there.} (

1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.cxd5 cxd5 4.Bf4 {in this early Exchange Slav variation, the
bishop move is the "hot" option acording to ChessBase. In the past couple years,
both Carlsen and Aronian have played it at the highest level. It also scores the
best (57 percent), although that score is not necessarily reflective of the
highest level.} 4...Nc6 5.e3 {in keeping with the London System-type bishop
development.} 5...Nf6 6.Nc3 Bf5 {Black continues with standard development.} 
7.Qb3 {the most challenging option. White takes immediate advantage of the Black
bishop's development away from the queenside.} 7...Na5 {there is an analagous
position in the Caro-Kann Exchange variation, in which Black faces a similar
choice in how to defend the b-pawn. In the Slav, the text move is both most
popular and best scoring, instead of defending with the queen.} 8.Qa4+ Bd7

the same problem.} 9.Qc2 e6 {the main alternative is the immediate ...Rc8.}

common idea, but Black has not had sufficient time earlier in the game for it.}

badly here, but White appears to have a slight edge. Note the difference between
this position and Black's move 12 variation, i.e. White's strong Ne5.} 15.f4

diagonal also frees up the Nf6 from defending h7.} ( 16...O-O $5 {is certainly
possible here and the engine considers the move to equalize. However, White's
pieces are all pointing at the kingside and he would no doubt launch an attack
using the kingside pawns as well. Black has good defensive resources in these
types of positions, but they can be hard to deal with in practical terms.} )

to me, although I've done something similar in a past related position, with the
idea of fianchettoing the queen for defensive purposes.} ( 17...O-O {looks
fine.} ) 18.Raf1 O-O 19.Rh3 {this is a major strategic decision for White, to
focus on piece play on the kingside or try for an attack by pushing the g-pawn.}

that White has no real ability to take advantage of Black's cramped position.}

on e5.} 22.Nf3 f5 {the engine considers this position completely even. Given the
semi-closed nature of it and Black's ability to easily defend the few weak
points, this evaluation seems logical. It is hard to see how White can make any
real progress.} 23.Nb5 a6 24.Nxc7 Rxc7 {with the exchange of minor pieces, Black
no longer has the two bishops, but is also less cramped.} 25.Ng5 Nf6 {moving
back to protect h7 again.} 26.Qa5 Bf7 {the bishop plays a useful defensive role
here, although it looks a little strange. Neither bishop is happy in this
quasi-Stonewall pawn formation.} 27.Nf3 {in keeping with the Stonewall theme,
the knight heads for e5.} 27...Rfc8 28.Ne5 Be8 {Black continues to preserve the
bishop.} 29.Rhf3 {beginning the transfer of the rook away from its now
unproductive h-file location.} 29...Bb5 {an interesting choice. Black sacrifices
a pawn for piece activity and practical chances.} 30.Bxb5 axb5 31.Qxb5 Ne4

the one on e4 is significantly more effective, since its counterpart on e5 has
all of its penetration squares on the 6th and 7th ranks covered.} 32.Rd1 Rc2

his pieces effectively together to create threats.} ( 33.Nd3 {was necessary to
defend.} ) 33...Qh4 $1 $17 {this gives up the d7 square to White, who however
has no time to take advantage of it.} 34.Rde1 ( 34.Qd7 $2 Rxg2+ $1 35.Kxg2 Rc2+

over the duty of protecting the e7 square.} 44.h3 h6 45.Qb5 Qc6 46.Qb4

terms White's best hopes to hold on are with queens on the board.} 46...Ke8

rook and better positioned to take advantage of it.} 48.fxg5 {this seems to play
into White's idea, effectively giving Black more space.} 48...hxg5 49.Nf3 Rc4

engine's choice, which is simply unncessarily flashy, allowing White's queen to
penetrate on h5 before he eventually loses to a mate in 11. One of the pitfalls
of using computer analysis is to think that this move would actually be better
over-the-board, when the text move also wins and is much more easily
calculated.} ) 57.g3 Qxd4+ 58.Qxd4 Rxd4 59.Nxe6 Rxa4 60.Nc7+ Kd7 61.Nxd5 Ke6

example} 16...b6 ( 16...Rb8 $5 ) 17.Na6 {and even though it is on the rim, the
Na6 is rather annoying for Black.} ) 16...a5 {this pawn break is now more
obvious, especially with the Nb3 as a potential target of the advancing pawn.}

of course cannot be exchanged without giving White an attack.} 19...g6 $15

effectively loses a tempo and Black gains the initiative. The engine has shown a
small plus for Black for several moves; at this point it becomes more evident.}

stuck on the rim (Na7-c8-d6). However, we will see there are compensations for
this.} 21.O-O h5 22.Qe1 Rae8 {this gets the rook into the game, so at least
there aren't two unproductive pieces on the a-file. However, it could be of more
use on the c-file, and eventually goes there.} 23.Nb1 {Black's space advantage
is now obviously seriously cramping White.} 23...Bd8 24.Rc2 Kg7 {getting the
king out of the way of the rook, so it can go to the h-file. This could also
have been played a move earlier.} 25.Qc1 Rh8 {White now faces a serious problem
on the h-file and the kingside in general, with Black threatening to advance

desperately needs protection. All White has going for her at this point is the
c-file, which however can be easily challenged by Black.} 29...Rc8 ( 29...Qxa4

1.Nf3 g6 2.g3 c5 3.Bg2 Bg7 4.c4 Nc6 5.Nc3 {via a somewhat unusual move-order we
have arrived at a Symmetrical English. Black will follow the plan of using ...e5
to challenge for control of the center and break symmetry, while White pursues a
queenside strategy.} 5...d6 6.O-O e5 {this advance gives Black a lock on d4 and
greater central presence/control via her pawns. On the other hand, it blocks the
Bg7 and creates a hole on d5.} 7.d3 {this opens up the c1-g5 diagonal for the
bishop and also helps restrain a potential future .. .e4 advance.} 7...Nge7 
{the standard place for the knight in this variation. The knight, if placed
instead on f6, would get in the way of both the Bg7 and the f-pawn, which Black
may play to f5 at some point.} 8.a3 O-O 9.Rb1 a5 10.Bd2 {White's dark-square
bishop development in this line is somewhat problematic, in that there is no
obviously good square for it that does not also get in the way of other pieces.
Keeping it on c1 makes no sense, however, so placing it on d2 is fine and the
most common option. There it may also help control b4 when the time comes to
make a pawn break there.} 10...Rb8 11.Ne1 {initiating the standard plan of
repositioning the knight to c2, from where it is able to help White force
through the b4 break. This looks awkward at first glance, but in reality the
knight is doing little on f3 and moving it also opens up the Bg2 to good effect
on the long diagonal.} 11...Be6 {Black similarly has little scope initially for
her non-fianchettoed bishop, but there is a more obvious choice of where to
place it. From e6, it can help cover the hole on d5 in tandem with the Ne7.
Black's subsequent push of the d-pawn is also consistent with the central
strategy originally initiated by playing ...e5.} 12.Nc2 d5 13.cxd5 Nxd5 {this
recapture is always done with the knight, otherwise White would gain the
advantage of the two bishops after exchanging with the Nc3.} 14.Ne4 {an uncommon
move. Exchanging on d5 with the knight is more common, as is the alternative
Ne3.} 14...b6 {the obvious way to protect the c5 pawn.} 15.Ng5 Bc8 {naturally
Black wants to preserve the bishop and avoid giving White the two bishops.}

shows White scoring over 70 percent in the dozen games available, although the
position seems quite equal (including to the engine).} 16...Nxe3 ( 16...Qxg5

followed by ...Nxe2.} 20.b5 Bg4 21.Nf3 ) 20.f3 {this is a committal and
seemingly antipositional move by White, who temporarily shuts off the Bg2 and
cuts off the f3 square from the Ng5. However, it's more dynamic than an
alternative like Re1.} ( 20.Nf3 $5 ) 20...Bd7 21.Ne4 axb4 $6 {although Black
still has a passed pawn after this trade, having an outside passed pawn on the

than before, since the passed pawn is protected by the Bd7.} ) 22.Bxd4 exd4

develop her queen first in an effective manner.} 23...Re8 {lining up against the
undefended e2 pawn and pinning the knight. This also frees up the f8 square for
a bishop retreat.} 24.f4 {interestingly this appears to be White's only good
move. It frees up the Bg2, most obviously, and her other pieces are already
optimally placed.} ( 24.Qxb4 $2 {this would lift the pin on the f-pawn, to
White's detriment.} 24...f5 25.Nd2 Rxe2 $17 ) 24...Bf8 ( 24...h6 {would be a
prophylactic move, taking away the g5 square from the knight.} ) 25.Ng5 
{another example of a patient master-level move. While Black has protected the
b4 pawn, her pawn structure in the center and queenside is shattered and too
vulnerable to protect in the long term. This means that White need not worry
about the material deficit. Instead, she now starts a threat of her own against
the weak f7 square. This threat trumps the previous pin of the knight against
the e2 pawn, which we therefore can say has been tactically broken.} 25...Be6

e6.} 27.f5 ( 27.Bc6 $5 Re7 28.Qxb4 {might be a simpler approach, regaining the
pawn with the idea of pursuing play on the queenside. In the game, White instead
prefers to increase pressure on the kingside.} ) 27...gxf5 28.Rxf5 {taking
advantage of the pin on the a2-g8 diagonal.} 28...Rc8 {the best way to improve
Black's position. She can't do anything about all of the air in front of her
king, but she can activate the rook on the open file.} 29.Bd5 {an excellent,
master-level move. White increases the pressure on the diagonal in the most
effective way, while the bishop cannot be taken for tactical reasons.} 29...Qd6

pawn, rather than placing her pieces on the most effective squares.} (

we'll see shortly.} 33.Rf1 {bringing another major piece into the kingside
attack.} 33...Rc3 34.Rf7 {threatening mate on h7.} 34...Rc7 {now we see why this

this time against the mating square g8 rather than the Black king.} 35...Bh6 $6

of the mate threat on g8, which is now covered by the Re8. She also probably saw
the threats she could make after placing the bishop on e3, but White is able to
easily parry them.} ( 35...Rc5 ) 36.Rxb5 $16 {now we see another drawback of
Black's move 32. She now has no material compensation for her positional
difficulties.} 36...Be3+ 37.Kg2 Qf8 38.Bf3 {shutting down any threats on the
f-file.} 38...Rc1 39.Qxb4 {ignoring the check on g1. This is also a
characteristic of master-level play, as amateurs too often are afraid of
checks.} 39...Rg1+ 40.Kh3 {emotionally these kind of moves can feel awkward and
scary, as the king has very limited squares. However, calculation shows that

1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 {entering the "Main Line" Caro-Kann, although these days
it's the Advance Variation (3. e5) that is most played at the professional
level.} 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5 {the Classical Caro-Kann.} 5.Ng3 Bg6 6.h4 h6 7.Nf3 
Nd7 8.h5 Bh7 9.Bd3 Bxd3 10.Qxd3 e6 11.Bd2 {the standard position in this line.
Now Black varies, however.} 11...a5 $5 {this appears to be a new idea. Very
little played, but with some recent high-level games where Black scores well.} 
( 11...Ngf6 {is normally played here.} ) 12.O-O-O {this seems to be an almost
reflexive choice by White and scores 40 percent in the database (the alternative
c4 scores 0 percent). The logic is that Black no longer can castle queenside
safely, so by default must have the king stay in the center or castle kingside.
White therefore castles queenside and keeps the rook on the h-file, for future
attacking possibilities. This does in part play into Black's main idea, however,
which is to gain space on the queenside and play there.} 12...Bb4 {this provokes
White's next move, which however is not forced. The move is universally played
in the database, an indication that it is considered the obvious follow-up idea
and the reason for playing ...a5 in the first place.} 13.c3 ( 13.Ne4 $5 
{ignoring the bishop sortie and spending the tempo on mobilizing the knight is
another option.} ) 13...Be7 {having done its job, the bishop returns to its
standard square. Now White's king is less secure, since the c3 pawn is a
possible target for a future pawn lever.} 14.Qe2 Ngf6 {at this point we have a
standard position, but with c3 and a5 thrown in. Structurally this has to favor
Black a little, but this may be offset by the tempo invested in the pawn move,
unless it is put to further good use.} 15.Ne5 {a standard attacking formation by
White, seizing the central square and freeing up the space in front of the
f-pawn.} 15...O-O {while it will take good defensive (or counter-offensive)
skills to protect the Black king, it's still far better off castled than sitting
on the e-file.} 16.f4 Re8 {this is a standard defensive rook move in this line.
While at first glance it may seem unnecessary, the e6 pawn can become a serious
weak point and tactical focus for White, so the Re8 will help with that, as well
as leaving the f8 square potentially open for a bishop retreat.} 17.Kb1 {this
proactively gets the king off the c-file and protects the a2 pawn.} ( 17.f5 {is
played in the only other game in the database, but Black is able to neutralize
this more aggressive approach.} 17...Bd6 18.fxe6 Rxe6 19.Nf5 Bxe5 20.dxe5 Rxe5

around this time, and this would still be a viable way to play. However, with
the advanced a-pawn and White's king on the queenside, the text move is
natural.} 18.Nf1 {this seems like it just wastes time. Although it frees up the
space in front of the g-pawn, so would the alternative Ne4. Perhaps White was
reluctant to let Black exchange a pair of minor pieces on e4, fearing it would
harm her attacking possibilities.} ( 18.Ne4 Nxe4 19.Qxe4 Nxe5 20.fxe5 a3 21.b3

contrast with the variation above, White's pieces are uncoordinated and Black's
look well placed to follow up on the ...c5 break.} 20.g4 cxd4 21.g5 {the point
of White's very aggressive play. Black now chooses the wrong path.} 21...dxc3

that White can now crash through on the kingside in a typical attack. However,

threatens to break everything open.} ( 22.Nxd7 Nxd7 23.h6 g6 24.fxg5 Bxg5 $15

tempting, but only profitable if the attack lasts. Here, White's king appears

compensation. It's well worth remembering that Black often needs to have a
centrally-placed queen in order to do well (or even sometimes survive) in the
Classical Caro-Kann.} 25.Bc1 Ne4 $1 {a hard move to spot, since it leaves the

1.c4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Nf3 Nc6 4.a3 {White has many playable options on move four
of the English Four Knights variation. This one is more in the spirit of a
reversed Sicilian, but can also transpose to more standard English positions (as
happens in the game).} 4...g6 {this is a standard English way to develop the
bishop and scores relatively well for Black (around 47 percent).} ( 4...d5 
{would be the way to directly challenge White, in the style of the Open Sicilian
(reversed). However Black only scores 42 percent in this line.} ) 5.d3 Bg7 
6.Bg5 {this isn't found in many high-level games and is an accelerated
development of the dark-square bishop.} 6...h6 7.Bxf6 {consistent, otherwise
White loses time retreating the bishop. The game is now already out of the
database.} 7...Bxf6 8.g3 O-O 9.Bg2 Bg7 {the bishop retreats to protect h6 and
get out of the way of the f-pawn.} 10.O-O {White now has a rather
standard-looking English position, as does Black.} 10...d6 11.Rb1 {White's
typical plan is to use the b-pawn advance to expand on the queenside and push
the Nc6 away, leaving the long diagonal open for White's bishop.} 11...a5 
{Black chooses to (temporarily) challenge the b-pawn advance, rather than move
forward with other development and preparing counterplay on the other wing. The
text move will result in opening the a-file for Black's rook, after the pawn
exchange.} 12.b4 axb4 13.axb4 Be6 14.Nd5 $6 {while it's a key principle of the
English to occupy d5 with a knight when advantageous, it's often difficult to
understand when it is best to do so. Here the knight move is premature, as it
would allow Black to block the long diagonal more effectively.} ( 14.b5 Ne7 
15.Qc2 {is a standard and good approach.} ) 14...Qd7 {with the evident idea of
playing ... Bh3 as a follow-up. This is rather slow, however.} ( 14...Ne7 $5 
{and now} 15.Nxe7+ Qxe7 16.Nd2 c6 17.b5 d5 $15 {is good for Black. For example} 
18.bxc6 bxc6 {and it's clear White has no threats, while Black has a strong
center and better prospects on the queenside as well.} ) 15.Nd2 {this now allows
the bishop to support the Nd5, which is in a strong position.} ( 15.b5 Ne7 
16.Nd2 {would also be fine. If the Nd5 is exchanged, White would have doubled
d-pawns, but the strength of the d5 pawn would be compensation for that.} 
16...Bxd5 17.cxd5 $11 ) 15...Ra2 {not a bad move, but the resulting continuation
is a little awkward for Black.} ( 15...Ra3 {is the rook move preferred by Komodo
8. The difference with the text move is that the rook on a3 controls c3 and
cannot be challenged by a White knight.} ) ( 15...Nd4 {is another possibility.
The knight otherwise is going to be placed rather awkwardly after White's b-pawn
advance. One sample continution:} 16.e3 Bxd5 17.cxd5 Nb5 $11 ) 16.b5 Nd8 
{essentially forced, in order to protect the b7 pawn.} 17.Nb3 {the idea behind
this move is apparently to support an eventual c5 advance. This eventually comes
to fruition, but the knight is nevertheless not optimally placed.} ( 17.Nc3 {is
the obvious move here, hitting the Ra2 and clearing the long diagonal for the
bishop.} ) 17...c6 18.Nb4 ( 18.Nc3 {is also still possible.} ) 18...Ra8 19.bxc6 
bxc6 20.Qd2 {it's sometimes difficult in the English to figure out the best
square for developing the queen. In any case, it's important to get the rooks
connected and maximize the queen's utility. Here the choice is between d2 and
c2. On d2, the queen has open diagonals (c1-h6 and a5-e1) but it's not clear if
they can ever be utilized. On c2, it might better support the queenside and
would leave d2 open for the Nb3.} 20...Bh3 $6 {Black follows up with her
original idea of exchanging the Bg2.} ( 20...f5 {is perhaps more to the point,
getting Black's counterplay on the kingside going sooner.} ) 21.Rfd1 $6 {this
effectively loses a tempo for White.} ( 21.Bxh3 $5 {an English player needs to
know when to exchange the Bg2 like this. While Black's queen always looks
threatening on h3, without the support of a knight or advanced pawns it will be
less effective.} 21...Qxh3 22.c5 {taking advantage of the Nb3's presence} 
22...d5 23.Ra1 $11 ) ( 21.Ra1 {is another alternative, challenging the Ra8.} ) 
21...Bxg2 $15 22.Kxg2 f5 ( 22...Ne6 $5 {would get the knight back in the game,
connect the rooks and again control c5.} ) 23.c5 {evidently this was the idea
behind the positioning of the Nb3.} 23...d5 24.d4 e4 {Black by this point has a
stronger center and more space, so White needs to turn her attention to trying
to contain Black's threats.} 25.f4 {this can be a key defensive move for White
in these position types.} 25...exf3+ 26.exf3 f4 27.g4 ( 27.gxf4 $2 Ne6 28.Nd3 
Qf7 $17 {and White's shattered kingside pawns will not provide an adequate
defense.} ) 27...Ne6 28.Re1 Ra3 $6 {making this rook more active isn't a bad
idea, but again this is not the best square for it on the a-file.} ( 28...Ra4 
{exerts indirect pressure on d4 and can't be chased off by a knight.} ) ( 
28...Rfb8 $5 {gets the other rook into the game effectively and illustrates how
White's opening of the queenside can also be a weakness, with Black's rooks
looking much better placed.} ) 29.Nc2 Raa8 $6 {this makes the maneuver just a
waste of time.} ( 29...Ra4 ) 30.Qd3 ( 30.Na5 $5 {threatening Rb7 is an
interesting idea.} ) 30...Qf7 31.Re2 $11 {at this point White has blunted
Black's initiative and can start manuevering again.} 31...h5 {a good practical
move by Black, as White does not find the best continuation.} 32.h3 $6 {this
sort of defensive move is often instinctual, as it appears more solid than
exchanging on h5. However, in that event White will be the one controlling the
g-file, so it's actually better.} ( 32.gxh5 gxh5 33.Rg1 $11 {followed by Kh1 and
White is fine.} ) 32...hxg4 ( 32...Qf6 $15 {threatening to penetrate on the
kingside, looks more effective.} ) 33.hxg4 Rae8 {this removes Black's
possibility of making threats on the a-file. If Black wants a rook on e8, Rf8-e8
makes more sense, since the f-pawn is already overprotected.} 34.Rbe1 {White
again looks fine, now that Black's threats have dissipated.} 34...Bf6 $6 {this
is too slow and allows White some initiative.} ( 34...Qf6 $5 ) 35.Nb4 {now the
knight is not tied to the d-pawn and can make threats of its own.} 35...Nd8 
{the only way to protect the c-pawn without losing something somewhere else.} 
36.Rxe8 $6 {this is not forced and is a good example of how it is often better
to maintain tension and even increase it, rather than release it prematurely.} 
( 36.Na5 {would be the most challenging for Black, who would then have to find} 
36...Bh4 {to keep things equal.} ) 36...Rxe8 37.Rxe8+ Qxe8 38.Qd2 {at this point
the position looks equal/drawn, so perhaps White simply wanted to head for a
draw earlier.} 38...Ne6 39.Na5 Nxd4 {one of multiple drawing continuations.
White will win the d5 pawn with her queen, but this leaves the back ranks open
for Black's queen to penetrate and give perpetual check.} 40.Naxc6 Nxc6

always takes on e4 in response. However, an alternative is ...g6 followed by

long diagonal.} 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5 {the Classical Caro-Kann.} 5.Ng3 Bg6 6.Nh3

unusual bishop move. The text move is also usually played in response to ... Bd6

to Nh3 as an independent line, as White takes advantage of the f4 square being
open (i.e. not occupied by a knight). It also influences g5 and e5 to White's
advantage.} ( 9.Nf4 {is usually where the knight goes.} ) 9...Qd7 {this doesn't
appear to be a bad move and reinforces f5. However, it blocks the Nb8's
development temporarily and the f-pawn's advance is not to be feared.} (

aggressive. White needs to be careful about the weak c-pawn, which is easily
attacked again, and also needs to bring the Nh3 into the game.} ( 16.b4 a5

the Qc7 is now pressuring c5 already. Also note the threat to h2 from the knight

looking at the tactics fully. If she could recapture on b8 with the rook, that

bishop goes to h2, it has targets on both c7 and b8.} 23.h3 Nge5 ( 23...Nf6

generates additional potential tactical problems for Black, now that the e-file
is under pressure. The Qc7 is a bit overloaded, as it cannot protect the Ne5 and
support an exchange on c5 at the same time.} 24...Bh4 {Black's best option,
getting the bishop off the e-file and gaining a tempo with the attack on the
Re1.} 25.Re2 Nbc6 26.Bxc6 {this dissipates some of White's pressure. The knight
will now also get off the e-file.} ( 26.Bh2 $16 {still looks very effective.} )

create two monster passed pawns for White.} 28.Nd5 {this position is probably
what White was looking at when she decided to exchange on c6. She still has an
edge, but with fewer pieces on the board there are less attacking chances.} 
28...Re8 29.Rxe8+ Qxe8 {with the additional exchange, Black probably was looking
to head into an endgame with a small disadvantage, but with good drawing
chances. The c-pawns look like they can be blockaded effectively.} 30.Nc7 $6

Black's queen moving to a much more effective centralized position, without
generating any evident threats.} ( 30.Bf2 {would be a clever tactical way to
improve White's position and get the Black bishop off the h4-e1 diagonal. The
bishop has to protect f6 due to the fork threat from the Nd5.} ) 30...Qe4 $11

the diagonal.} 32.Nb5 Qe1 {with the threat of ...Bf2} 33.Nd6 $2 {White chooses
to counterattack with a threat to f7, but she runs out of threats first, losing
the game.} ( 33.Nd4 {is the necessary defensive move.} 33...Nxd4 34.Qxd4 $11 )

best try for White, but still leaves Black winning. For example} 37.Qxf5 Be5

with this move, but saw correctly that White would not be able to deliver mate

1.d4 f5 {The Dutch Defense is an opening that often uses alternative
move-orders, especially to reach a Stonewall formation, as seen in Annotated
Game #147 (a Slav Stonewall). Here Carlsen plays very straightforwardly with the
text move. This may have had a psychological element as well, since the
Leningrad Dutch - something Carlsen had played recently and lost with - is a
more common choice and essentially requires Black to start with ...f5.} 2.g3

fianchetto against the Dutch.} 2...Nf6 3.Bg2 e6 4.c4 c6 {a useful illustration
of move-order importance, as White could exchange on d5 with a slight advantage

the main line of the Modern Stonewall.} 7.b3 Qe7 8.Ne5 {Bb2 and a4 (preparing
Ba3) are much more popular choices. The text move is the third most often played
and scores well (60 percent) - even better than the other two moves - but this
may reflect the quality of opposition as well. The drawback of White's choice
here is that it does not immediately help his development.} 8...O-O {Carlsen
drew the one previous game he had played in this line, with the alternate choice
of ...b6 (the modern approach to Stonewall development). While the text move is
relatively noncommittal, if Black wants to play ...b6 and continue his
development by getting the light-square bishop out, the earlier the better.} (

an unimpeded diagonal to be of any use, so the "natural" square on c3 is not as
good. The knight will also be able to transfer to f3 and support e5 that way.}

to disrupt White's queenside. This goes against traditional ideas of the
Stonewall, which feature play exclusively in the center and kingside. However,
Black can effectively distract White by using this approach and perhaps (as in
this game) later on generate some chances himself on the queenside. Black need
not fear White simply taking the a-pawn, as the pawn is not defensible and the
capture may cause more problems by weakening the queenside structure.} 12.Ndf3

the diagonal for his bishop. Note how effective the a3 pawn becomes as a result

pawn play on the e file (occupying e4 after the knight vacates it) or support a
thematic push of the f-pawn.} 20...Bxe5 21.Rd1 Qe6 {moving the queen off the

basis. He's currently the world number 2, so it seems to be working for him.}

Bishop sortie can be unexpected and highly annoying.} 2...c6 {this is only the
fourth most popular move (...g6 being the primary choice in the database), but
scores the best for Black (45 percent).} 3.e3 Qb6 {this is the idea behind the
previous move. Since White has developed his bishop early, Black will seek to
take advantage of its absence on the queenside. This is also analagous to other
"poison pawn" variations (such as in the Najdorf Sicilian) involving taking the
b-pawn with the queen.} 4.Nd2 {this scores much better in the database than the
cautious defensive move b3. Here's a sample of how Black could play in that

no fear of the consequences to Black's kingside and considers the position

in what direction his opponent wishes to go.} 11...Re8 {following a similar plan
as in the game cited above.} 12.Re1 Bf8 {this is a logical follow-up and
presumably aimed at defending the kingside, but the bishop is obviously less
active than it could be elsewhere, for example on d6. Unlike the above game

necessary to activate the bishop.} 13.dxc5 bxc5 14.cxd5 exd5 15.Qc2 h6 (

Black did not like the looks of opening the long diagonal to White's Bb2.} )

battery on the diagonal. It also serves as another waiting move for Nakamura,
which works to his advantage.} ( 16.Bf5 {is a more conventional approach.} )

maintaining a strong kingside defensive presence.} 17.Bh7+ Kh8 18.Bf5 {the
advantage of this sequence, beyond simply moving to f5 directly, is that Black's
king is slightly more vulnerable and her g-pawn is pinned, creating some
tactical ideas for White.} 18...Rb8 {moving away so the Nd7 is freed from the
pin on the diagonal.} 19.Qa1 {very hypermodern of Nakamura and an idea
associated with the Reti Opening. The queen in the corner exerts pressure on the
center and against Black's king.} 19...Qe7 $6 {one gets the impression that
Black did not know how to proceed in this type of position. White now
immediately takes advantage of this slip.} 20.b4 {threatening to continue with
b5, which would be very awkward for the Nc6. Again the idea is to dominate the
center through indirect means, in this case chasing away a piece defending e5.}

has other useful things he can do.} 22.Nb3 {the exchanges have given White a
potential strong outpost on c5. Black's d-pawn is also now isolated and White
has the square in front of it (d4) blockaded, making the pawn weak.} 22...Nde5

Nxe5 24.Nc5 {after the piece exchange White's position is improved, with the
strong c5 outpost occupied; note also how Black's Bf8 is doing nothing
constructive. Here perhaps Nakamura expected the symmetrical ...Nc4 from Black,
occupying her own outpost and cutting off the c-file. However, Harika goes wrong
with her next move.} 24...Nf3+ $2 {this sacrifice must be either the result of
miscalculation or desperation on Black's part.} 25.gxf3 Qg5+ 26.Bg4 h5 27.Nxb7

threats.} ( 29.Qxb7 $4 gxf3+ 30.Kf1 Qg2# ) 29...Qe7 $18 {so White emerges from
the sequence with an extra (passed) pawn and a winning game.} 30.b5 {passed
pawns must be pushed!} 30...Qd7 31.b6 Bb4 32.Red1 Re6 33.Bd4 {note again how
Black's dark-square bishop is not doing anything constructive and how its White
counterpart is helping dominate the game.} 33...Rh6 $2 {this attempt to generate
some threats on the h-file in fact leads to quick victory for White, as the rook
partially blocks an outlet for the cornered Kh8.} ( 33...Bd6 {would allow
resistance for a while longer.} ) 34.Qa8+ Kh7 35.Rc8 Kg6 36.Rg8 Rh7 37.Qc8

a GM) endgame win, so Nakamura does not mind that possibility.} 37...Qe7 {this
leads to a quicker, merciful end.} ( 37...Qxc8 38.Rxc8 Ba5 39.Ra1 Bxb6 40.Ra6

pinning the Nc6.} 7...Bd6 {the most active square for the bishop. Black does not
need to worry about the d5 pawn at the moment; the only drawback of the bishop's
presence on d6 is blocking the Qd8's defense of the pawn.} 8.d4 {an unusual
decision at this point, as White normally castles and may not necessarily follow
up with d4.} 8...cxd4 9.Nxd4 {White now has a classic (reverse) IQP position.}

moving ...Be5 to pin the knight, results in a position where white's king has
fewer potential flight squares.} 13.Qc2 {protecting the Bb2 and therefore
unpinning the knight, while exerting pressure down the c-file.} 13...Bd7 14.Nf3

the long diagonal for free.} 14...Bxb2 15.Qxb2 Rac8 16.Rc1 {this move is rather
committal, as White's heavy pieces are now all on the queenside.} 16...Qd6

queen's knight has been rather neglected until now.} 17...Ne5 $6 {the normal
strategic rule in playing IQP positions is for the player NOT possessing the IQP
to exchange pieces; this leads to fewer complications and causing the pawn's
weakness to become more pronounced. It's not clear why Black chose to ignore
this rule, since the piece exchanges that follow are entirely voluntary.} (

play against the IQP than it is for Black to come up with any real counterplay.}

pawn" is ugly but effective in supporting d5.} 21.Nb5 Bd7 {Black appears content

draw as a prospect.} 22.Qd4 {continuing to exchange pieces.} ( 22.Nxa7 $2 Ra8

excessively loosen Black's position and grant White some initiative. The pawn
becomes a significant weakness later in the endgame.} ( 23...a6 ) ( 23...Ne4 ) 
24.g4 {This is the type of move that is sometimes difficult for Class players to
envision, since it weakens the pawn shield in front of the king. However,
Kramnik reacts appropriately to the situation and judges that the game has now
reached the stage, with the queens off the board, of an endgame where his king
needs to be activated. The advanced g-pawn also controls additional space.} 
24...h6 25.Kg2 $14 Rxc1 26.Rxc1 Rc8 27.Rb1 {an interesting choice. Basically, if
White exchanges the rooks, he technically has a slight edge, but it's very
doubtful he'll be able to do anything significant to compromise Black's position
with only the two minor pieces remaining. With the text move, White retains the
rook and Kramink evidently still hopes to squeeze out a win if Black falters.} 
27...Ra8 {perhaps this is intended as a threat to advance the a-pawn, although
it doesn't seem very significant.} 28.Ne2 {White switches plans and repositions
the knight to directly pressure the IQP.} 28...g5 {I'm not sure what this was
supposed to accomplish, as White's g-pawn was already restrained and the Ne2 can
simply go to c3 instead of f4. It was probably better to use the tempo to get
the rook back in the game.} ( 28...Rc8 ) 29.Nc3 Be6 {back to static defense of
the pawn.} 30.Rd1 Rd8 {play is predictably revolving around the IQP. With the
Rd8 unprotected, however, White can use this tactical situation to force the
issue with his next move.} 31.e4 d4 {otherwise the pawn is lost.} 32.Kg3 
{Kramnik does not rush to take the pawn, first removing the king from a
potential tactic involving a check from a future ...Nf4.} ( {For example}

knight fork on f4.} ) ( 32.Rd3 $5 {is also possible, blocking the pawn from
advancing. The knight still cannot be taken due to the pin against the
unprotected Rd8.} ) 32...Rc8 33.Nb5 Nd7 {as the d-pawn is lost, black
repositions the knight to a better square in the center, also blocking the
e-pawn.} 34.Nxd4 Ne5 {although White is now a pawn up, Black has some positional
compensation in the form of his better-placed pieces. In particular, the Rc8
threatens to penetrate White's back ranks.} 35.Be2 ( 35.Nxe6 $6 fxe6 36.Be2 Rc2

the c2 square against Black's rook.} 37...Kf6 {Black is looking to get his king
into the fight.} 38.Nf5 Bxf5 {a good decision by Black to exchange. The knight
would be powerful on the 5th or 6th ranks (f5 or d6) and White's pawns are
doubled as a result, making it a little harder for him to make progress.}

centralized on the dark square e5 and help restrain White's kingside advance.} 
43...Rxc6 44.hxg5 hxg5 {"all rook endings are drawn" is a saying that is not
technically true, but is often the case because they are so hard to win. White's
extra pawn is doubled and Black's rook and king are active, so it's not simply
"a matter of technique" to win from this point.} 45.a4 Rc3 46.Rb5 Rc6 47.f4

order to drive the king away from supporting f4. Of course, the drawback is
abandoning the b6 pawn. As typical in rook endgames, one cannot get something
for nothing. The engine assesses that conducting a straight exchange on f4 and
continuing to protect the b-pawn would be better for Black.} 48.Kf2 gxf4

Black heads for a Stonewall by transposition.} 4.e3 Bd6 {typically ... f5 would
be played immediately when transposing to the Stonewall. The text move may try

it leaves his central d5 outpost unchallenged.} 5.Nc3 f5 6.Bd3 Nf6 {Black has
now reached the standard Modern Stonewall formation.} 7.Bd2 O-O 8.O-O Ne4 {the
overwhelming favorite move in the database. Black follows the typical Stonewall
plan with his knights, seizing the outpost on e4. With White's bishop on d3, the
Nc3 cannot exchange off the Ne4 due to the resulting pawn fork.} 9.c5 {this move
scores only 6 percent (!) in the database out of nine games, illustrating its
strategic weakness.} 9...Bc7 {Black's bishop is no less effective on c7, as its
primary function is exerting pressure on the b8-h2 diagonal.} 10.b4 a6 {there
are several different ways Black could play here. The game continuation is
relatively straightforward, restraining further advance of the b-pawn, then
getting the knight and queen developed.} 11.a4 Nd7 12.b5 {White's plan of rapid
queenside expansion looks like it puts him ahead of Black in development.
White's initiative is only temporary, however, as Black's position holds no
weaknesses despite White's space advantage.} 12...Qf6 {this does multiple things
for Black, including adding support for the idea of the ...e5 break and
positioning the queen well for further action on the kingside.} 13.b6 {this move
is probably unavoidable, according to Komodo 8. Black is threatening to
undermine the queenside pawns with ...e5, so maintaining the tension with the
b-pawn could eventually lead to a collapse of White's extended pawn formation.
However, once the queenside pawns are locked up, then the game becomes
strategically much easier for Black; the only open play is on the kingside,
which is the natural hunting ground for the Stonewall.} 13...Bb8 {the bishop is
still very much in play here, although the Ra8 is now locked to its square. The
problem with the rook will be offset by the inability of White to transfer his
queenside rook, or other needed forces, to the kingside in an effective manner.}

to hold onto the extra pawn and hope White's initiative proves fruitless.
Normally Black would also try to look for a way to give back the material to
fully equalize, for example in the move 17 variation below.} 16.Bf4 Qd8 {the
queen has to move off the b8-h2 diagonal because of the threat of discovered
attack.} 17.Ng4 {containing the obvious threat of exchanging the Nf6 and playing
Qxh7 mate.} 17...g6 {this weakens the king position and helps make Black's edge
more concrete.} ( 17...Nbd7 $5 18.Be5 h6 19.Nxf6+ Nxf6 20.Bxf6 hxg5 21.Bxe7

easier for White to play.} ) 18.Nxf6+ Bxf6 19.Ne4 Bg7 ( 19...Be7 $5 {helping
cover d6 may have been better, in light of White's 21st move, although it's
understandable wanting to fill the kingside holes.} ) 20.Bg2 $16 {the long
diagonal becomes more important to occupy again, now that the sac threat against
e6 is over. The engine's significant plus for White is easy to visualize here,
given White's advantage in development (five pieces to one) and space.}

seize yet more space.} 21...Re8 22.Rac1 Qd8 {moving back to the original square.
Black has to be frustrated by this point.} 23.Bc5 Ba6 24.Bb4 Qc7 {playing
defensively around the c6-pawn. But now Nakamura illustrates the principle of
the benefits of opening the position when ahead in development, as well as
highlighting the tactical danger of placing pieces (the Qc7) onto undefended
squares.} ( 24...Bb7 ) 25.d5 $1 $18 {this pawn lever effectively breaks open the
position for White's pieces in the center.} 25...exd5 26.Nd6 {the point being a
double attack (with the knight on the Re8 and the Bg2 on the d5 pawn; the c6
pawn is pinned against the Qc7 and no longer protects d5).} 26...Qd7 {hoping
that giving back material (i.e. the Re8) will exhaust White's initiative.} (

material on the board and the balance is roughly even, but White still has the
far-better developed pieces, so continues to find success by opening lines in
the center.} 28.e4 d4 29.e5 {and the pawn is tactically protected, as either the
bishop or queen taking on e5 would be followed up by Re1, losing Black
material.} 29...h5 {this gives Black an escape square on h7, but there's little
else he can do at this point.} 30.f4 {the pawn on d4 is now doomed and trying to
keep the material balance doesn't help Black.} 30...f6 31.Rxd4 fxe5 32.fxe5 Bc8

1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 d5 3.cxd5 Nxd5 4.g3 {by far the top choice in the database. White
goes for immediate piece pressure in the center using the long diagonal.} ( 
4.Nf3 {is the second most popular choice in the database. White avoids
committing to the early fianchetto.} ) 4...g6 5.Bg2 Nb6 6.Nf3 {in contrast with
the move 4 variation, White has chased away the Nd5 before her own knight comes
out.} 6...Bg7 7.O-O {retaining maximum flexibility for as long as possible.} 
7...Nc6 8.d3 {White cannot reasonably play d4 here, due to Black's piece
pressure on the center, but this more modest pawn advance releases the c1 bishop
and asserts control over c4 and e4.} 8...O-O 9.Rb1 {an interesting choice by
White. Instead of playing a natural bishop developing move, for example Be3 or
Bd2, as a follow-up to the previous move, she prefers to initiate queenside
action immediately.} 9...Bf5 {a somewhat puzzling square for the bishop, since
it's left potentially exposed to harassment by a knight or by an eventual e4 or
g4 push, should circumstances favor that. It is in a position to prevent Ne4,
however, as a minor piece exchange on e4 would then give Black a 3-2 pawn
majority on the queenside.} 10.h3 {this appears to be aimed at nullifying a
potential future Q+B battery on the c8-h3 diagonal, after which White plays Kh2
to defend h3. White by this maneuver ensures that she keeps the Bg2 on the board
rather than having Black try to exchange it.} ( 10.Be3 {alternatively would
simply ignore Black's idea of exchanging the bishop, in favor of development.
Play could continue} 10...Qd7 11.Qd2 Bh3 12.Bh6 Bxg2 13.Kxg2 {and now White will
be able to likewise exchange Black's bishop on the long diagonal, which is at
least as valuable as its White counterpart.} ) 10...e5 11.b4 {White presses
ahead with her queenside expansion plan.} 11...Nd4 12.Nxd4 $6 {this
unnecessarily gives Black a strongly-supported central pawn, without sufficient
compensation elsewhere in the position.} ( 12.Nd2 $5 $11 {looks a little
passive, but it unleashes the Bg2 and keeps White's options open.} ) 12...exd4 
13.Ne4 {now White's knight lands on a nice central square, but it may have been
of more use on c3, hitting b5 and d5.} 13...Nd5 {Black now has a nicely
centralized knight of her own.} 14.Bd2 {by this point there are no real
alternative squares for developing the bishop.} 14...c6 15.b5 {an easy move to
play for White, since her main idea, starting with the 9th move, has been to
push the b-pawn into Black's camp. This is a standard minority attack idea,
seeking to undermine support for Black's center.} 15...Qe7 {a safe-looking
choice, although White's next move is also obvious and will help give her
targets on the queenside.} ( 15...cxb5 16.Rxb5 {and White will have dynamic play
on the queenside, although Black's strengths in the center balance this, along
with the long-term 2-1 majority on the queenside.} ) 16.bxc6 bxc6 17.Qc2 
{pressuring the backwards c-pawn on the half-open file is now an obvious
strategy for White.} 17...Rac8 18.Rb3 {with the idea of dominating the open
b-file.} ( 18.Qc5 $5 Qxc5 19.Nxc5 {would be a nice-looking positional gain for
White, occupying c5 with a knight and opening up the long diagonal.} ) 18...c5 
{Black correctly looks to advance and then hopefully liquidate the c-pawn, which
otherwise will be a long-term weakness.} 19.Rfb1 {consistent, but it gives Black
the opportunity to resolve the situation with the c-pawn.} ( 19.Rc1 $6 {would
fail to prevent the advance of the c-pawn, which tactically still works:} 
19...c4 20.dxc4 Nc3 21.Bxc3 dxc3 $17 {and White is cut off from protecting the
c4 pawn, which Black will soon be able to take and thereby restore the material
balance, while also having control over the center and a menacing passed
c-pawn.} ) 19...Nb6 {this appears to be a turning point in terms of the
initiative. Instead of pressing forward, which is tactically possible, Black
retreats and then focuses her attention elsewhere.} ( 19...c4 {and now play is
similar to the above variation:} 20.dxc4 ( {inserting} 20.Rb7 Qa3 {may be an
improved version of the idea for White} ) 20...Nc3 21.Bxc3 dxc3 $15 ) 20.Rb5 
{adding sideways pressure against the c-pawn.} 20...Rfe8 21.Bg5 {White is now
the one making threats and forcing Black to play reactively.} ( 21.Rxc5 $2 Bxe4 
$19 ) ( 21.Nxc5 $6 {the pin against the Qc2 will prove awkward after} 21...Be5 
$15 {and now Black threatens simply ...Bd6, also with ideas of possibly
sacrificing on g3 in the future.} ) 21...f6 $2 {a very committal move that is
also unnecessary; there are several reasonable queen moves. Blocking the Bg7
effectively takes away a key piece from Black's game. Although Yip then moves to
undo the block, the whole process leaves her more vulnerable and White
well-positioned to exploit this.} 22.Bf4 Bxe4 23.Bxe4 f5 24.Bf3 {now it's
obvious that White can support an h-pawn advance with her bishops.} 24...Be5 
{Black continues to attempt to exchange her way out of her difficulties.} 
25.Bxe5 Qxe5 {it's interesting to see that the minor piece exchanges have had
their desired effect on the kingside, but look at the remaining pieces. White's
light-square bishop is huge, while the black knight is mostly ineffective.
White's rooks are also very active and the c-pawn's weakness is magnified.} 
26.Rc1 Nd7 27.Qc4+ {White's light-square dominance is well illustrated by this
sequence.} 27...Kh8 28.Rb7 Qd6 29.Rxa7 $18 Ne5 {still trying to exchange her way
out of trouble, except now she is material down.} 30.Qd5 {a safe approach to
handling the position.} ( 30.Qb5 {is the engine's suggestion, but it involves
giving Black some more risky-looking activity, for example} 30...Nxf3+ 31.exf3 
{and Black has the e-file to work with and some potential kingside counterplay,
although it does not work out in calculation, largely because the c-pawn is too
vulnerable to capture.} 31...Qc6 32.a4 $18 ) 30...Nxf3+ 31.Qxf3 {White's
advantage is solid - a passed a-pawn and no real weaknesses, while Black still
has the backwards c-pawn - and Black can do little about it.} 31...Qb6 32.Rb7 
Qe6 {targeting the one slightly weak point (e2) in White's position and
supporting a c-pawn advance...which, however, will be problematic.} 33.Rc2 c4 
$2 {this advance comes far too late now and out of desperation.} ( 33...Qc6 $18 
) 34.dxc4 {the simplest approach, just take the pawn.} 34...Rxc4 35.Rxc4 Qxc4 
{optically it looks like the position is not terribly worse for Black, with the
weak c-pawn now gone, but now her exposed king position can be exploited by
White's queen.} 36.Qf4 $1 {an excellent example of a decisive queen move that
does multiple things. Useful ones include covering c1, getting on the open b8-f4
diagonal and pressuring the d-pawn. However, the most important threat is now to
Black's h-pawn, which cannot be adequately defended from the Q+R combination.}

1.c4 c5 2.Nc3 g6 3.g3 Bg7 4.Bg2 Nc6 5.Nf3 e5 {breaking the symmetry and
establishing a central pawn presence.} 6.O-O Nge7 {the idea here is not to block
the f-pawn's advance later.} 7.Ne1 {White's idea is to redeploy the knight via
c2. This is slow, but the opening is largely about maneuver rather than attack.}

increase domination of the d5 square.} 8...h5 $5 {this move scores well in the
database - although see the next annotation - but is not often played. There is
only one game listed in 2015 with it, for example.} ( 8...Be6 {is the more
conventional choice, along with castling.} ) 9.d3 {both Komodo and the database
indicate that the reaction h4 should be avoided. In the small sample (19) of
games available, it has been played roughly half of the time and scores badly at

h-pawn, she should go all in.} 10.Ne3 {most played here, although the engine
evaluates that first proceeding with standard play centered around the b-file is
fine.} ( 10.a3 a5 11.Rb1 a4 12.Bg5 f6 13.Bd2 h3 14.Bh1 O-O 15.Ne3 {is one
possibility.} ) 10...Be6 {this gets the bishop out, but Black did not need to
develop it this early, as it is doing fine on its original square for now. It
does nothing to impede White's next move.} 11.Ned5 f6 {this seems a little
premature and commital.} ( 11...h3 $5 {is the engine's choice, which would avoid
White's later gxh4.} ) 12.Qe1 {Yu here is signaling a shift in commitment to a
kingside strategy, placing her queen on the e1-h4 diagonal and preparing her
next move.} ( 12.Rb1 $5 {would continue with queenside and central play.} )

opposite wing, making White's threat of expansion on the kingside less urgent.} 
14.fxe5 fxe5 $6 {this looks like a logical and "clean" move visually, but
immediately gives White some advantage to play with, including the open f-file
and the initiative. From here on out, the game gets wilder.} ( 14...Bxd5 $5

White does an admirable job of covering the weaknesses and playing actively.}

weaknesses, especially on f7, with the absence of this bishop. White has a
number of ways to take advantage of this.} ( 15...Bxd5 {is still a good idea,

rook move, she has shut down threats along the f-file. White can also no longer
trade down material, as in the previous variation.} 19.Ne4 {centralizing the
knight and recognizing that the e4 square is superior to b5 for it now.}

that would not turn out particularly well for White.} 9.Qe1 {at around 48

really behind in development, as she will have an easy time getting her bishops
out, compared to the Bc1. White's minor pieces are all forward deployed, but not
working together particularly well. Komodo assesses the position as equal, but

behind in development.} 20...e5 {Black has an excellent position, but it's not
clear exactly what plan is best. Dominating the c-file looks good, while taking
the b2 pawn at this point does not. In the game, Goryachkina with this move

the best defense.} 23.g3 Nc5 {a "good enough" type of move that preserves

1.Nf3 d5 2.g3 Nf6 3.Bg2 {it's been noted by commentators that Kramnik in 2016
often largely avoided theoretical duels in the opening, in favor of simple flank
opening development early on. This parallels Carlsen's similar practice of often
"just playing chess", a strategy that succeeds when your overall level of
understanding and effort is better than your opponent's.} 3...Bf5 4.O-O c6 
{Black is using a Slav-type structure, which is solid if unambitious.} 5.d3 e6 
6.Nh4 {a standard maneuver against a Slav bishop developed to f5.} 6...Bg4 7.h3

of an e-pawn advance.} 8...Be7 9.f4 Nfd7 {pressuring the Nh4, among other things
so that it cannot support f4-f5.} 10.Nf3 {White's last two moves have now given
him a mainline Leningrad Dutch (!) structure in reverse. Kramnik knows these
structures well.} 10...f5 {presumably aimed at deterring the thematic Leningrad
Dutch e-pawn advance, but...} 11.e4 {anyway!} 11...Bxf3 {an understandable
decision to exchange minor pieces, as the bishop is currently largely locked out
of the game by its own pawns on the light squares.} 12.Bxf3 {nevertheless, the
exchange seems to leave White in a good position on the kingside, with his own
bishop now improved.} 12...O-O 13.Nc3 {White at this point has a clean structure
with his pieces working relatively well together. Black now has a Stonewall pawn
structure, but his pieces are not as well placed or developed.} 13...fxe4 
14.dxe4 d4 {this seems overly ambitious. Black completely gives up his solid
central pawn wedge in a forward thrust for space. It certianly inconveniences
White temporarily, but in the longer term it weakens Black's game.} 15.Nd1 e5 
16.Nf2 {Kramnik has plenty of time to usefully reposition the knight, as Black
has to take additional time to shore up his advanced d4 pawn and get his pieces
out.} 16...c5 17.Qe2 {putting the queen on more useful diagonals and clearing
the back rank to connect the rooks.} 17...Nc6 18.Bg4 {a beautiful place for the
bishop. Now the downside of Black's earlier decisions - to exchange off his
light-square bishop and advance the pawn wedge - is highlighted.} 18...Kh8 
19.Be6 exf4 {done in order to inconvenience and disrupt White's kingside.} 
20.gxf4 {here Komodo assesses the position as completely level, although it
seems easier to play as White. Adhiban makes a rather drastic decision to try to
further disrupt White's structure, but this time the weaknesses he leaves behind
after the g-pawn advance become more acute.} 20...g5 $6 ( {After something like}

Kh1 followed by Rg1, etc.} ) 21.Ng4 {the knight hops to a strong square, with
multiple benefits (blocking the g-file, eyeing h6 and f6 as well as e5).} (

looking really good now.} 22...Qe8 {shifting diagonals with the idea of

to proceed. Kramnik picks a world-class and complex way, by offering the Ng4.}

discovered attack, but its effectiveness is not lessened any, plus e5-e6 is now
a possibility. White's space advantage and mobility gives him a significant
plus.} 24...Qg6 25.Kh1 {avoiding the ...h5 threat, now that the Qg6 is present.} 
25...Bg5 {naturally Black seeks to exchange off one of White's two bishops, but
to no avail.} 26.Bh2 {again, the bishop retreat shows no loss of effectiveness
for the piece, plus the f-file is uncovered.} 26...Nb6 ( 26...Rxf1+ {would be an
attempt to exchange off material and reduce White's threats, but after} 27.Rxf1

still best.} 28...Qd5 29.e6 $1 {passed pawns must be pushed! White now would be

White's positional advantages, with the pawn sitting on e6.} 30...Rxf8 31.Ne5 (

waiting move, but also done to take away the b4 square from Black (usually to
prevent ...Nb4 as a reaction to Qc2).} 11...Bh3 12.Bxh3 {masters can play this
move with ease in the English, even though it looks anti-positional. If Black
could follow it up by bringing additional pieces into a kingside attack, then it
would be bad, but often the exchange on h3 simply means that Black's queen is
offsides for a while.} ( 12.b4 {is not a bad other option, but in this position

1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5 4.Bd3 {the Exchange Variation has been making a
comeback at high levels.} 4...Nf6 ( 4...Nc6 {is the main line, forcing White to
play c3 in response.} ) 5.c3 {White plays it anyway, which eventually leads to a
transposition back to the main line, at least for Black.} 5...Qc7 {placing the
queen on c7 this early used to be a quirky sideline. It's now more mainstream,
I'm sure in large part due to its practical success. The main idea is
straightforward, to take over the b8-h2 diagonal and prevent White from playing
Bf4. As the queen wants to go here in most lines anyway, playing it early and
preventing White's bishop from seizing the diagonal makes a lot of sense.} 6.h3 
{this is seldom played. The evident idea is to take away the use of the g4
square from Black, for either the knight or bishop.} 6...g6 {a new move in this
position according to the database, but not a new idea in the Exchange
Variation. Black looks like he is fianchettoing his bishop, but in fact the main
idea is to play play ...Bf5 and then open the g-file.} 7.Nf3 Bf5 8.Ne5 {White
holds off on the bishop exchange and places his knight on the e5 outpost, ready
to take back on d3. This also potentially opens up f3 for his queen.} 8...Nc6 
{although this position isn't in the database, for Black it's a standard setup
in the Exchange Variation. In this game, White is further behind in development
than normal, with only two pieces out to Black's four.} 9.Bf4 {now White has
essentially caught up, as Black will have to move the queen again either
immediately or after an exchange on e5.} 9...Qb6 ( 9...Nxe5 {it might seem under
general principles that exchanging off White's central knight is a good
proposition. However, leaving the a4-e8 diagonal open results in a small plus
for White. For example, this continuation leaves Black's king in the center:}

real prospects.} ) 10.Bxf5 gxf5 {this is what Anand was going for with the
variation.} 11.Nd3 {this avoids a possible exchange on e5 and protects b2, but
is still a backwards move of the same piece in the opening. Moreover, exchanging
on e5 or taking on b2 for Black does not look dangerous.} ( 11.Nd2 Nxe5 (

development.} 12.Rb1 Qxa2 13.O-O Qa6 14.Ra1 Qb5 15.Qf3 $16 {with Rfb1 a threat.}

for Black in this structure.} 12.Nd2 {getting the final minor piece out.} 
12...Rg8 {by this point Black has achieved a dynamic equality. He has some
longer-term structural weaknesses (including the h7 pawn and dark-square holes)
but in return he has dynamic piece play and the half-open g-file.} 13.O-O O-O-O 
{the only real place to put the Black king, also developing the queenside rook.} 
14.a4 {now that Black has committed with his king, White grabs some space on the
queenside. This is not dangerous for Black, though, as a4-a5 is not yet
possible.} 14...Ne4 {improving this piece considerably, as the most it was doing
on f6 was guarding h5. With Black's king tucked away on the queenside, though,
that is not critical.} 15.Rc1 ( 15.Qh5 Rg7 $11 ) ( 15.f3 Ng3 16.Rf2 Be7 $11 ) 
15...Bd6 {a case where exchanging minor pieces is clearly indicated for Black.
White's dark-square bishop would otherwise help dominate the dark squares, while
the Black counterpart has nowhere else as useful to go.} 16.Bxd6 Nxd6 17.b4 
{this type of position is important for Caro-Kann players to understand. White's
pawn thrusts on the queenside look scary, but Anand deals with them
effectively.} 17...Kb8 {taking the king off the c-file and removing it from
potential tactics involving the rook opposite it. Also vacates the c8 square for
another piece. This is a good example of a move that "doesn't do anything"
immediate but is valuable in the long run, with White not having a concrete
threat in the meantime.} 18.Qe2 ( 18.a5 Qc7 19.Nc5 Ne4 $11 ) 18...Qc7 
{proactively retreating the queen. It was doing no good on b6 anyway, now it can
move along the 7th rank and also is well-positioned on the b8-h2 diagonal.} 
19.Qe3 {White with this move basically admits he has nothing on the queenside
and tries to generate some action in the center.} 19...Ne7 {improving his
weakest piece. On c6 the knight was shut down by White's pawns.} 20.f3 $6 
{perhaps attempting to be prophylactic and shut Black's knight out of e4.
However, now White has a more serious dark-square weakness, absent his bishop,
and it affects the space in front of his king, with g3 and e3 now becoming more
vulnerable.} ( 20.Kh1 {would step away from the g-file and keep the balance.} ) 
20...Ng6 {Black's knight immediately gets into play. The threat is now f5-f4, as
we shall see.} 21.Ne5 $2 {White must have miscalculated the impact of Black's
next move.} ( 21.Kh1 {as in the previous note is more prudent, but Black still
gets an edge.} 21...f4 {the pawn is tactically protected, due to a "removal of
the guard" being available if White takes with the knight.} 22.Qe1 ( 22.Nxf4 $2

{this just clears the way for Black on the g-file, but White appears to be
losing in all variations.} ( 23.Rf2 {would be analagous to the above variation,
but now White has a lot more problems. The Ne5 is vulnerable to ...f6, among
other things.} 23...Ngh4 $1 {and White has no good response to Black's threats,
including piling up on the g-file and playing ...Ne3.} 24.Nf1 ( 24.c4 {doesn't
gain White anything after} 24...Rc8 $19 ) ( 24.Ng4 h5 25.Nf6 Rg6 26.Qe5 Ne3

1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5 4.Bf4 {an alternative try to the usual Bd3. White
accelerates his seizure of the h2-b8 diagonal and does not let Black's queen get
to c7.} 4...Nc6 5.c3 Nf6 ( 5...Bf5 {is in alternative way to play, anticipating
the Bd3 development by White and looking to exchange off bishops early. In the
game, this happens much later and also results in a change of Black's kingside
pawn structure.} ) 6.Nd2 {the second most popular move in the database. White
prepares to support Ngf3 after Black's next.} 6...Bg4 7.Qb3 {a normal reaction
by White, once the bishop ceases protecting the b7 pawn.} 7...Qc8 {this is less
committal than the alternative ...Na5.} 8.Ngf3 e6 9.Bd3 ( 9.Ne5 $5 {is an
interesting idea here, but simply retreating the bishop to f5 seems to take any
sting out of it.} 9...Bf5 $11 ) 9...Bh5 {a relatively rare option, with ...Be7
being standard. The idea here is to retreat to g6 and exchange off the Bd3,
which otherwise is well-positioned to target Black's kingside.} 10.O-O Bg6 
11.Bxg6 {Komodo, in contrast to some other engines, assesses that it is better
for White to not exchange on g6. For White, often the idea behind this exchange
is to create a target for an h-pawn thrust, which is what in fact occurs later
on.} 11...hxg6 12.Rae1 {committing to a central/kingside strategy.} 12...Be7 
$11 {Taking stock of the position, Black has full equality. The light-squared
bishop exchange has left Black solid on the kingside and White has no obvious
advantage, although he can try for play on the h-file, as in the game. Duda's
next move is a novelty in the database and was likely an attempt to introduce
some uncertainty into the position, while again looking for chances on the
h-file.} 13.g3 $146 {as we will see later, the idea of this move is to prepare
the pawn thrust h2-h4.} ( 13.Ne5 {is a typical try by White that scores well in
the database (67 percent), but should not objectively be a concern to Black. The
database figures also seem to be skewed by lower-rated games.} 13...Nxe5 
14.dxe5 Nd7 {similar to the game continuation looks fine for Black.} ) 13...O-O 
{no reason to postpone castling.} 14.Ne5 Nxe5 {Black chooses to remove the
well-placed central knight immediately. Although not forced, this is an
excellent defensive idea, as otherwise White typically starts developing
tactical ideas on the e-file to target the e6 pawn, with a knight sacrifice a
possibility later on g6 or f7.} 15.dxe5 Nd7 16.h4 {White follows up on his
earlier idea of g3. Should Black be worried? As the defender in this type of
position, the usual assessment is that after two minor piece exchanges, Black
should be all right, since the sacrificial possibilities by White are limited.
White will also need time to bring his other pieces to bear on the kingside.} 
16...Nc5 {puts the knight on its best square, kicking the queen and eyeing e4
and d3.} 17.Qc2 Qc6 {putting the queen on the long diagonal and improving its
mobility. Now White's lack of a light-squared bishop to oppose it is
highlighted.} ( 17...b5 {is what the engines like in this position, following up
with ...Qb7 to put the queen on the long diagonal and give black the option of a
minority attack on the queenside.} ) 18.Re3 {this just ends up being awkward for
White and wasting time. Presumably the idea was to eventually transfer the rook
along the third rank.} ( 18.Nf3 $5 ) 18...Qa6 {pressuring the a-pawn and also
placing itself on another useful diagonal.} 19.Qb1 {with this move, it's clear
that White no longer has the initiative and must start responding to Black's
threats.} 19...Rac8 20.Kg2 {needed to clear the first rank for his rook to shift
to h1.} 20...b5 {now Van Foreest plays the pawn advance, gaining space and with
the eventual idea of a minority attack along with the a-pawn.} 21.Bg5 Qb7 
{although Black has been moving his queen often, each time it has been with a
purpose and has improved his relative position. This time is no different, as
the queen will still be well-placed on e7 after the exchange of bishops, and the
a-pawn is now free to advance.} 22.Bxe7 Qxe7 23.Rh1 a5 24.Qd1 b4 {Black's
counterplay on the queenside balances White's play on the kingside.} 25.Qg4 ( 
25.h5 {would amount to the same thing after} 25...bxc3 ) 25...bxc3 {active
defense.} ( 25...Qb7 $5 {is another interesting way to defend.} 26.h5 d4+

better than a perpetual.} ) 26.bxc3 Rb8 {Black again correctly emphasizes
counterplay, threatening to go to b2 with his rook.} 27.h5 g5 {Van Foreest goes
for the option that is equal, but allows him to keep going in hopes of a win.
The correct decision, as it turns out.} ( 27...Rb2 28.hxg6 fxg6 29.Qxg6 Rxd2 
30.Qh7+ Kf7 {is a perpetual for White.} ) 28.h6 g6 {this defensive idea should
be well known to Caro-Kann players, to prevent a breakthrough on the h-file.} 
29.Nf3 {targeting the weak g5 pawn, but} 29...Ne4 {holds everything together for
Black.} 30.Re2 {covering the second rank against the threat of ...Rb2. However,
this leaves the c-pawn hanging.} 30...Nxc3 31.Rc2 Ne4 32.Nd4 {although Black is
a pawn up, now White gets to have equivalent play for it, gaining the initiative
in compensation. The main threat here is the knight fork on c6.} 32...Rbc8 
33.Nc6 Qa3 {preserving the a-pawn.} 34.Rhc1 Kh7 {another important defensive
idea for Black, blockading the h-pawn to prevent a future sacrifice on h7. The
h-pawn is now a long-term liability for White, especially in an endgame, when
Black opening the h-file by capturing the pawn will no longer be of consequence.
Black does have to be careful to manage potential threats from any occupation of
the f6 square by White, however.} 35.Qe2 {now Black has to take care of his Ne4,
which is out of squares after a White pawn advances to f3. Previously it could
have gone to d2, with the tactical idea of Rxd2 followed by ...Qxc1. The Qe2
instead now covers the d2 square.} 35...g4 {Black gives back the material so his
pieces regain freedom of movement.} 36.Qxg4 Rc7 37.Qf4 {this appears to be a try
by White to maintain winning chances.} ( 37.f3 {leads to lines where Black can
win the a-pawn, but his queen is too exposed to White's rooks for it to matter,

the a2 pawn or not.} ) 37...Rfc8 $15 {obvious and good. Now White has to be

currently under-protected rooks.} 38.g4 $6 {White likely underestimated the
consequences of Black's next move.} ( 38.Qg4 Qd3 $15 ) ( 38.Nd4 {bailing out

the GM level) should be able to convert the endgame with his extra passed

as before, but now threatening ... Qf3+. By this point, White is essentially
lost.} 40.Rc3 ( 40.Qg3 {is objectively better, but still leads to a lost
endgame, so White tries something else.} 40...Qxg3+ 41.Kxg3 Kxh6 $19 ) 40...Qa4

move-order with an early ...e6 can have independent significance, or transpose
back to the "main" main line Caro-Kann. Usually Black plays ...Nd7 here, to
prevent Ne5.} 8.Bd3 {this early bishop development deviates from White's
standard ideas of h4-h5 or an immediate Ne5. However, in many lines it is normal
for White at some point to exchange off the light-square bishop and develop the
queen.} 8...Bxd3 {there is no good alternative to exchanging bishops.} 9.Qxd3 
Nf6 10.Bf4 Qa5+ {this is the standard reply to the Bf4 development. Black asks
White if he wants to maintain the bishop on f4, in which case the c-pawn will
have to block the check, or if the bishop will give up its more active placement
on f4 and retreat to d2.} 11.c3 Be7 {developing the bishop before the b8-knight,
but this seems reasonable, since there is no other good square for it. Liang by
doing this gives himself some additional options with the knight, beyond going
to d7.} ( 11...Qa6 {is another idea, but may be more drawish.} ) 12.Nf1 $146 
{this (new) idea is to redeploy the knight and advance with g2-g4, while leaving
the king in the center. While the idea of attacking down the g-file is now
standard in some variations, this is an accelerated version of it. White does
not seem quite ready to back it up, however.} 12...c5 {Black is able to play
this thematic break while his own king is still in the center, since White has
no way of taking advantage of it. The light-square bishop is off the board,
Black's Qa5 prevents White's queen from using the f1-a6 diagonal, and White's
own king is still in the center as well.} 13.N1d2 Qa6 {...O-O and ... cxd4 also
look like good options here. The text move pressures White to exchange queens,
which is difficult to avoid.} 14.Nc4 {White blocks the queen trade, but at some
positional cost. White's queen is now hanging, it is useful to observe, and the
Nc4 will also have to be protected.} 14...O-O 15.g4 $6 {White is not as well
positioned to back up this kingside aggression as in other lines. Liang
nevertheless chooses to avoid taking the g-pawn, which would open up the file.}

in the subsequent variations. White maintains material equality, but Black ends
up with an edge.} 16.dxc5 ( 16.g5 Nh5 17.Bd2 cxd4 18.gxh6 dxc3 19.Bxc3 Nb4

the bishop and staying solid on the kingside, but solidity was not Nakamura's
original intent with g2-g4.} ) 16...Nc6 {Black develops the knight, connects the
rooks, and hits the bishop all at once.} 17.g5 h5 {another solid option for
defense, reducing the complexity and number of targets for White to go after.}

example} 18.gxh6 Nxe5 19.dxe5 Nf4 20.Qe4 Ng2+ 21.Kd1 ( 21.Ke2 $4 f5 {and the Nc4
is lost.} ) 21...f5 $17 ) 18.g6 $2 {White decides to go all in and try to
continue the attack, but Black is now winning. The engines point out the least
worst variation, which however would have meant no more dynamic play for White
and a solid positional advantage for Black.} ( 18.dxc5 Bxc5 19.Bg3 $15 ) 
18...cxd4 {despite the pawn thrust, White is not in fact urgently threatening
anything on the kingside, so Black can go ahead and start his own counterplay.
The text move undermines e5 and starts opening lines for Black's pieces.}

his king.} ) 19...Nxd4 {Liang again chooses a more straightforward option,

rooks. Black is now a pawn up and has much better piece placement and
coordination. In particular, the Bd4 is centralized but blocked in and White has
to worry about ...e5.} 25.a3 {preparing to castle, but weakening the light
squares further.} 25...Rcf8 ( 25...Kh7 $5 {to protect the g-pawn and free up the
Rf5.} ) 26.O-O-O Kh7 27.Rhg1 Nf6 {Black is now able to powerfully reposition the
knight and cut off any attacking possibilities down the g-file.} 28.Qc2 Ng4

prefer simply exchanging down, given Black's material and positional
advantages.} 31.e5 Rc8 {switching targets and prompting White's next move, which
unblocks the f1-a6 diagonal and further blocks in the White bishop.} 32.c5 Rcf8

considerations. Several other possibilities exist to make progress.} ( 32...Rd8

simplifying exchange.} 35.Rxd1 Rd8 {Black's good knight vs. bad bishop situation
is now even more clear on the board, along with his material advantage. Although
he has doubled g-pawns, later he can get rid of them and have strong passed
pawn(s) on the kingside.} 36.Rd2 Qc6 {physically blockading the c-pawn and
moving to the more central diagonal.} 37.b4 Rd5 38.Bc3 Ne3 {the engines agree
with this idea, which passes up taking the e-pawn in favor of a more dominating
central position for Black.} ( 38...Nxe5 39.Qd1 Rxd2+ 40.Qxd2 $19 {still leaves
Black with an advantage, but White has more mobility and the road to victory

this position with the above variation, it's clear that Black's pieces are more
dominant.} 42.Kb2 Qd3 ( 42...Nxh4 $5 {apparently Liang did not want to go into a
pure queen ending, even two pawns up.} 43.Qxh4 Qxd2+ $19 ) 43.Bg5 Nd4 44.Qc3

however.} 44...Qe2+ 45.Kb1 Qxe5 46.a4 {White is desperately seeking counterplay
at this point, trying to mobilize the queenside pawn majority.} 46...a6 {the
simple way to restrain White's pawns.} 47.Kb2 Qe2+ 48.Qd2 Qe4 {leaving the way
open in front of the e-pawn and laterally pressuring the h-pawn, keeping the
bishop tied to its defense.} 49.Qc3 e5 50.Qc4 Qg2+ 51.Kb1 Qc6 {using the full
power of his queen to influence both sides of the board.} 52.a5 {now Black fully
dominates the light squares and White cannot hope to make progress.} 52...Nb5

make the d-pawn a better target for him. The position remains equal, but is
easier to play for Black, who has more obvious targets (White's h- and
d-pawns).} 23.f3 {pushing back the advanced knight and removing the f-pawn from

effective now, since the rook formerly on h8 has found freedom on the other side
of the board.} 25...Kf8 26.Ne3 Rcd8 {a simple but effective doubling of rooks
against the d-pawn.} 27.Nc2 {with White's pieces more awkwardly placed and
restricted, Black by this point has a slightly more concrete edge than simply
enjoying an easier position.} 27...b6 {increasing Black's control of the 5th
rank and preventing ideas of Ra5, for example. At this point Black can be said
to have the initiative as well, since White is running out of useful moves and
will have to respond to Black's ideas.} 28.Rde1 {taking advantage of the fact
that the knight is anchoring the pawn on d2, also removing the under-protected
rook from any potential tactics involving the d-file.} 28...Rd6 {this
potentially frees up the d7 square for the knight and provokes White's next
move. These types of ideas can be difficult for amateurs to spot. Often we look,
in a too-narrow fashion, to always "do something" with the piece being moved. In
this case, the rook itself is no better off on d6, but it accomplishes something
useful for Black's other pieces.} 29.c5 Rd5 {So was evidently fine with allowing
a trade of rooks. From a practical standpoint, a player with stronger technique
usually finds it easier to win a single rather than double rook ending. This
move further pressures the h5 pawn, so White is forced to deal with that threat
over the next couple of moves.} ( 29...R6d7 {also looks good, maintaining the
tension on the d-file. The square d5 is now also available for the knight.} )

respond to the fork threat on d3.} 34.R1e3 f6 {the engines prefer the idea of

moving it to the edge, in fact offers So a way to further imbalance the
position.} ( 37.Ka2 {is the engines' choice.} ) 37...fxe5 {similar to White's
previous setup with his d-pawn, now Black's knight supports a central pawn
against the pressure of two rooks. The difference is that Black's knight is much
better placed than White's was, and Black's rooks are more dangerous. As we will
see shortly, there is also a tactical point to the e-pawn's newly-won control of
d4.} 38.a4 $2 {under pressure, White goes wrong. With this move, he evidently

the "book" N1e2, namely deploying the knight to f4. It does not seem to have
independent significance and is not mentioned in theory books, although it is
interesting to see that it is roughly equivalent in the database - actually with
a few more games - to N1e2.} 6...Nf6 ( 6...e6 {is the other main response.} ) ( 
6...h6 {is the third most popular, but scores very well for White. There is no
need to prevent the knight from going to g5 and preparing to retreat the Bg6
loses time for Black.} ) 7.Nf4 Nbd7 ( 7...e5 {has been the traditional antidote
to this variation since the Tal-Botvinnik matches in the 1960s, but the line can
be drawish, so likely was avoided by Nakamura for this reason. Here's a high
level example:} 8.Nxg6 hxg6 9.dxe5 Qa5+ 10.Bd2 Qxe5+ 11.Qe2 Qxe2+ 12.Bxe2 Nbd7

more typical White idea in this position, pressuring the e-file and threatening
some tactical ideas if Black gets careless with development.} 10...Bd6 {and now
White can sac on e6, but it only maintains equality if Black defends correctly.
However, it could certainly be a good practical try, Ivanchuk lost a blitz game
against Duda in this line.} 11.Rxe6+ fxe6 12.Nxe6 Qb6 13.Qe2 Ke7 {and now the
defensive idea is to play ...Rae8, perhaps after a4 and ...a5 are inserted. That
way the king can flee via d8 and not lock the rook out of the game.} ) 10...Bd6 
11.Qf3 {Defending the Nf4. Also, by placing his queen on the h1-a8 diagonal, he
influences e4 and d5 and eyes b7 in the event Black goes for the typical ...c5
break, which Nakamura does play immediately.} 11...c5 {after an exchange on c5,
recapturing will help activate Black's minor pieces. White could also push the
d-pawn in response, but Black does not have any problems there.} 12.dxc5 ( 
12.d5 {there are not in fact any database games with this line. White players
likely do not want to give up the center so easily.} 12...e5 $5 {may be the
easiest way to neutralize White's chances.} ) 12...Bxc5 ( 12...Nxc5 {no one
plays this way, since the knight will just have to go back.} 13.Bb5+ Ncd7 )

threatened.} 13...O-O-O {by castling opposite sides, Black signals further that
he is looking for winning chances. It is also the engines' top choice. While
Black's king position looks more open, he has effective local superiority on the
queenside, as White is much better positioned for action on the kingside. The
half-open c-file and queenside pawn majority are also not immediate problems, as
it will be tough for White to mobilize anything there. Finally, White's
dark-square bishop is currently out of the game, something which is corrected
shortly, but still leads to problems.} 14.Nxg6 $2 {positionally, this allows for
the bishop to come to a more active square, but ignores the even more
significant extra activity that Black gains as a result, most notably through
the opening of the h-file. Tactically, White needed to prepare the piece
exchange more, as now he gets pushed around and gives Black the initiative.} ( 
14.Be3 ) ( 14.Qe2 ) 14...hxg6 $17 {this is exactly what Black wanted with
queenside castling, now the Rh8 is ideally placed to exert pressure on White's
king position.} 15.Bf4 e5 {now Black is firmly in control.} 16.Be3 e4 {I think
it likely that White underestimated or missed this move, attacking the queen
with tempo. The Ng3 is pinned against the mate threat on h2, is the problem.} 
17.Qe2 {abandoning the kingside to its fate.} ( 17.Qf4 $5 {would put up more
resistance on the kingside.} 17...Bd6 18.Qg5 Ne5 $19 ) 17...Bxe3 ( 17...Rxh2 
{is also possible immediately, but trading bishops simplifies the calculations.} 
) 18.Qxe3 ( 18.fxe3 {would avoid the threat of a K+Q fork on h2 and e3, but has
its own problems, namely that the Ng3 will no longer be protected after the
sacrifice on h2.} 18...Rxh2 {and the rook still cannot be taken, due to}

it is not enough, either.} 21.Rxf6 Nxf6 22.Bxf7 Kb8 {and Black wins material
after ...Qh2+, thanks to the hanging Ra1. Trying to defend with Qf2 loses to the
deflection tactic ...Rh1+} ) 18...Rxh2 {this thematic sacrificial breakthrough
idea should always be looked at when the other rook is available to immediately
come to the h-file.} 19.Rfd1 {nothing better than to give White's king a path to
run.} ( 19.Kxh2 $2 Ng4+ ) 19...Rdh8 {Black is now simply up material with a
strong attack and dominating position. He does not have an immediate
combinational win, but White is going to have to drop material or worsen his
king position considerably.} 20.Qxa7 {re-establishing material equality at
least, in the hopes that Black cannot carry through with his attack.} ( 20.Rxd7

gives White a look at Black's next developing move before making any other
decisions about piece placement.} 7...Nc6 ( 7...O-O {seems more consistent with
the early Bishop move, also waiting to see where to go with the Nb8.} ) 8.Bxc6+

a different strategic path. It is a classic trade-off decision, eliminating the
strong White bishop but inflicting permanent structural damage on Black and

evaluate the position as equal.} ( 8.Nf3 {is of course the conventional move.}

queen after White's next.} 12.Ne4 {Black now has an important strategic decision
to make. Her choice to castle queenside is very imbalancing and appears to go
against the position's needs. Kosteniuk must have felt that either the king was
safe enough there, despite the weak pawns, or that she would be able to attack
White first.} 12...O-O-O $6 {Black tactically protects e5, as the Ne4 is now
hanging due to the pinned d-pawn. However, White gets out of the pin by moving
his queen to a better square, lining up on the c-file, so it is a net minus for
Black.} ( 12...f6 {is the engine recommendation, protecting the pawn.} ) (

damage on White in return. However, Black's c-pawns are still worse than White's
e-pawns and Black would no longer have the two bishops.} ) 13.Qc2 $16 f6 
14.Rfc1 {putting a rook on c1 is clearly a good idea, creating a battery with
additional pressure. An argument could be made for moving the other rook, since
the a-pawn will not need its support to advance, but White evidently wanted to
put both heavy pieces on the queenside.} 14...Kb7 {a reasonable-looking
defensive move, but Black may be better off looking for some counterplay.} (

undermine White's d-pawn.} ) 15.b4 $5 {a move that no amateur would be likely to
consider, as it just appears to lose a pawn.} ( 15.a4 {is the more obvious way
of launching operations on the queenside.} ) 15...Bxb4 16.Rab1 {now we see the
idea of the pawn sacrifice, to attack down the b-file. It appears to be slower
than alternatives, though, as Black looks to equalize with ...Rd5 or exchange
off an attacking piece with ...Bxe4. In practical terms, it is still difficult
to meet, however.} ( 16.a4 Rd5 17.a5 Nd7 18.Bxe5 $5 fxe5 ) 16...Be7 {withdraws
the bishop from its current vulnerable square, eliminating tactics involving a
discovered attack after the Bb2 moves (for example Bd4 or Bxe5). This does
little to impede White's attacking ideas, however.} ( 16...Rd5 {this defends

center against the rook and bishop. For example} 17.Bd4 Ba3 18.Nc5+ Bxc5

despite the material difference, meaning that with accurate defensive play Black
will be all right. If Kosteniuk calculated this far, however, it would hardly
look appetizing.} ) ( 16...Bxe4 $5 {may be the best practical choice here,
eliminating an attacking piece and reducing complexity.} 17.dxe4 a5 {physically
impeding White's future a-pawn advance} 18.a3 Be7 $14 ) 17.a4 {with the idea of
pushing away the knight. Bringing another piece into the attack might boost its
effectiveness.} ( 17.Nfd2 {appears to be a useful preparatory move, as the Nf3

file.} 18.a5 Nd7 {although Black has been pushed around, White does not have
anything decisive and now looks to recover the pawn. However, there is no rush
to do so and he ends up in a slightly worse position with the move played, so
alternatives are worth looking at.} 19.Qa4 ( 19.Ra1 $5 {with the idea of Ba3 and
trading off White's worse bishop, helping fight for the dark squares onthe
queenside.} ) ( 19.Qxc6+ Qxc6 20.Rxc6 {regains the pawn more forthrightly and
seems to give Black less leeway than the game continuation.} ) 19...Rb8

pressure on the c-file. White has managed to rearrange his pieces to be less
awkward and can look to exchange off his worse dark-square bishop with Ba3.}

reasonable move, getting the king out of the corner and reinforcing the pawn on
c7. It has a tactical problem, though, which Tarjan finds.} ( 32...Bd5 {or
moving to f7 or g8 would avoid the problem, which is created by the king making

hybrid with ...Bb4, but it seems most often a QGD formation is set up from
here.} 3...d5 4.e3 {White has committed to central play and there is no longer a
potential gambit situation on the queenside, now that the c4 pawn is protected.} 
4...a6 {the move actually scores pretty well, leaving Black around 50 percent in
the database, but it seems a little slow, given White's flexibility here.} 5.b3 
{by far the most played. White develops his dark-square bishop and protects c4
again, allowing him to choose to retake with a pawn in case of an exchange and
exert more control over d5.} 5...Bd6 {a good square for the bishop, also
signaling that Black will look to use his control of e5 strategically.} (

was a novelty in tournament play, although it has been tried several times since
with good results. The idea of sacrificing the g-pawn to open the file in this
manner is a theme encountered in other openings.} 7...Nxg4 {Black chooses to
accept the challenge head-on.} ( 7...dxc4 {is an alternative.} 8.g5 Nfd7 9.Bxc4

pawn. The point is to reinforce d5 while supporting a potential ...b5 pawn
thrust.} ) 8.Rg1 f5 {Black maintains the knight outpost, at least temporarily,
while still allowing for ...Nf6 in the future. It also opens the 7th rank to
lateral defense. However, it leaves the kingside a little loose and weakens e6,
a fact which White later exploits.} 9.cxd5 e5 {Anand has given the pawn back
immediately, but now maintains the advanced e5/f5 pawn duo.} 10.h3 Nf6 11.Ng5 
{even with material equality, White needs to play actively to justify his
uncastled king and isolated h-pawn. The knight gets into the game - not being
very effective on f3 - by eyeing e6 and also clearing the diagonal for the
queen.} 11...Qe7 {covering e6 and g7.} ( 11...h6 $2 {this might be the obvious
move played at the club level, in order to kick the knight. Let's see what would
happen.} 12.Ne6 Bxe6 13.dxe6 {while at first glance White's pawn looks weak,
Black has no immediate way of dealing with it and his own f-pawn has similar
problems.} 13...Nc6 14.Qf3 {and White has threats of Bc4 and Qg2 coming up,
along with queenside castling as a possibility.} ) 12.Qf3 {this allows the queen
to move to the g-file, pressures f5, and also places it on the long diagonal.
This last point is shortly used to good effect.} ( 12.Ne6 {the engines agree
that this is best played immediately.} 12...Bxe6 13.dxe6 {and the pawn is
temporarily immune from capture due to the Bc4 skewer tactic. White can then
follow up with Qf3.} ) 12...Kh8 ( 12...e4 $5 13.Qg2 Nbd7 14.Ne6 Rf7 15.O-O-O

preference. Again, leaving the strong Ne6 in place looks counterintuitive, but
White still does well from the exchange.} ) 14.dxe6 Qxe6 15.Qxb7 {White now has
the bishop pair and his pawn structure overall is no worse than Black's.}

for White here.} ( 16.Bxa6 {pawn snatching may be possible, but Black should get
some compensation in terms of the half-open a-file and a strong center, while
White's king starts looking a bit vulnerable.} 16...e4 ) ( 16.O-O-O ) ( 16.Qc6 
) 16...Qe7 17.Qg2 Nb6 $11 {White has no more immediate threats to make and Black
has equalized. White will need to do some maneuvering to start playing
dynamically again.} 18.Be2 a5 {looking to break up White's pawns and make
inroads on the queenside.} 19.Bb5 {a good example of prophylaxis. It feels a bit
strange to move this bishop yet again, but it is the best way to prevent ...a4.}

returns the knight.} 22...Nf6 ( 22...Qxg5 23.Rxg5 {and now White's king position
is much improved, lacking a queen to threaten it, and with two bishops and the
half-open c-file to play with.} ) 23.Rd1 {at this point queenside castling would
not seem to be an improvement for White's king, so the center is reinforced.} 
23...e4 {this logical-looking move causes Black a few headaches, after White's
next. The long diagonal is opened and Black loses control of d4 and f4, although
gaining space.} ( 23...Qe6 {maintains Black's grip in the center.} ) 24.Qh6

immediately moves to contest the open long diagonal.} 25...Be5 26.Bxe5 Qxe5

solid defensive move, but in fact it leaves White's queen too active.} (

endgame advantage after} 32.Ke2 Nxf4+ 33.Qxf4 Qxf4 34.exf4 Nxc4 35.bxc4 $18 {as

the game.} 33.Ne2 ) 33.Ke2 {White now has no real weaknesses and his pieces are

protecting g1.} ) 33...a4 34.Ne6 {White goes back to the weak e6 square, this
time unchallenged.} 34...Rf7 35.Nf4 {this is sufficient to win without the
complications of attempting a direct attack.} ( 35.Nd8 Rg7 36.Rg1 $6 {allows

engines' best try} 37.d3 Qb2+ 38.Rd2 Qc3 39.Ne6 $18 ) 37.Qc6 {forking the Ne8

1.e4 c6 2.Nf3 d5 3.d3 {this gives the move order with an early Nf3 an
independent significance. Otherwise, Nc3 is a transposition to the Two Knights
variation and e5 can result in an Advance variation, for example.} 3...g6 {this

directly in the center, either by exchanging on e4 or with ...Bg4.} 4.e5 
{gaining space and eliminating the opportunity for Black to exchange central
pawns.} 4...Bg7 5.Bf4 {in some gambit-type openings, this type of setup to
protect the pawn with the bishop might be necessary and the extra material would
help compensate for the awkward piece placement. Here, the more simple d4 seems
indicated, even though it's a double move for the pawn in the opening.} 5...Qb6

developing the queen to a nice square, pressuring on the g1-a7 diagonal.} 
6.Nbd2 {offering the "poisoned" b2 pawn, as its capture would not be bad for
White.} 6...Nh6 $6 {this is just an awkward placement for the knight. Komodo
Dragon suggests ...Nd7 and ...Bh6 as alternatives. In the latter case, an
exchange on h6 would remove one of White's developed pieces.} ( 6...Qxb2 7.d4

with developing pieces to useful squares.} ) 7.Nb3 $14 {choosing to put the
knight on a better square and block the b-file, protecting the b-pawn.} 7...Bg4

now the idea of the ...c5 break is eventually possible, with the d5 pawn
protected.} ( 10...a5 $5 {the engines like this idea here, which helps fight for
c5 if White allows Black to chase away the Nb3, or weakens White's queenside if
the a-pawn goes to a4 to block Black's advance.} ) 11.g4 {now that the center is
locked, this kind of thrust on the wing is strategically sound.} ( 11.Bd3 $5

lack of utility from the start on h6.} 12.h4 {with the knight now out of the
way, White lacks good targets for the pawn advance, so developing a piece might
have been more useful.} 12...f6 {a thematic pawn break, also seen in French

open additional lines to the king.} 15...O-O-O {this gets the king out of the
way, but allows White a dominating space advantage.} ( 15...Nh6 {ironically
seems better, by physically preventing the h-pawn advance, although a human
player probably would not consider moving the piece back after such a
humiliating sequence.} ) 16.h6 $18 Bf8 17.c4 d4 ( 17...dxc4 $2 18.Bxc4 $18 {and

knockout.} 18...Be7 {this clears the square for the rook, but also blocks the
knight from developing.} 19.Kb1 {this doesn't appear necessary, but perhaps
White wanted to see what her opponent would do next.} 19...Rf8 {without much to
do on the d-file, the rook swings over to the f-file.} 20.Qe4 {maintaining the
Q+B battery but limiting the queen's potential scope.} ( 20.Qg3 $5 {would
overprotect the e5 pawn and guard f2, while leaving the queen a bit freer.} )

1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.Nf3 Qb6 6.Bd3 {the Milner-Barry Gambit.} 
6...cxd4 7.O-O {cxd4 is overwhelmingly played in the database, but the text move
is favored by higher-rated players and scores a little better as well (around 50
percent). White gets on with development and gets the king to safety.} 7...Bd7 
( 7...dxc3 8.Nxc3 $14 {here White has three minor pieces developed to Black's
one, good open lines for the bishops, and prospects of getting the queen to
f3/g4/h5 for kingside pressure. Well worth the gambited pawn.} ) 8.Re1 {again we
have a split between the heavily played database move (cxd4) and the text move
favored by master-level players (and the engine). Here the rook overprotects the
e5 pawn, freeing up the Nf3 to move.} 8...Nge7 9.h4 {a typical attacking move in
these types of positions. White has been concentrating on development until now,
but has no need to move the Bc1 given its beautiful scope on the kingside, and
the Nb1 stays at home in case it needs to recapture on c3.} 9...a6 {by playing
this, Black argues that her kingside defense is better off by leaving the pawns
at home and flexible.} ( 9...h6 $5 {this is the most played, based on a small
sample size. Black here chooses to context the g5 square and pay some attention
to kingside defense.} ) 10.h5 {pressing ahead on the kingside. This rules out
...Ng6 and threatens further disruption to the pawn structure.} 10...h6 
{physically blocking further advances of the h-pawn and taking control of g5.} 
11.Qe2 {develops the queen to a square from where she protects the b-pawn, forms
a battery on the f1-a6 diagonal, and reinforces the e-file.} 11...f5 {this
appears to have been done in order to provoke White's next response, which
leaves Black somewhat better off in objective terms. The engine assesses that
White could have exploited the resulting pawn structure weakness with a more
patient approach.} ( 11...dxc3 $5 12.bxc3 $10 {and White's pawn structure looks
fragmented, but the c-pawn does a good job of covering the key b4 and d4
squares.} ( 12.Nxc3 $6 Qb4 $15 ) ) 12.exf6 {for reasons mentioned in the
previous note, here the engine advocates developing the knight to a3 or d2,
which gets it into thae game, as retaking with the pawn on c3 is fine for
White.} 12...gxf6 13.cxd4 Nxd4 14.Nxd4 Qxd4 15.Be3 {the key moment in this
sequence. Black's queen is exposed and needs to be careful, being faced with
White's centralized bishop pair. Bailing out with ...Qb4 is possible, although
the engine strongly favors ...Qh4, calculating that the queen cannot be trapped.
In practical terms this would be difficult to play, of course. Black instead of
the above chooses to keep her queen centralized, presumably wanting to keep
using it in defense of the king. However, this gives White other opportunities.} 
15...Qe5 $6 16.Nd2 $14 {simple but effective. White now gathers her forces for a
push in the center and kingside, with the pieces cooperating well together.
Meanwhile, Black's forces are disorganized and relatively undeveloped, with the
pawn not enough material compensation for White's positional edge.} 16...Rg8 
{developing the rook to a more effective file.} 17.f4 Qd6 18.Qf2 {forming an
effective dark-square Q+B battery on the diagonal, with Bc5 and Bb6 now a
possibility, and lining the queen up on the f-file against Black's weak f6
pawn.} 18...Rc8 {getting the other rook out to its best file.} 19.Rad1 
{although this lines the rook up against the queen on the d-file, it seems to be
more of a waiting move. Given that her opponent has no obvious plan at this
point, this can be an effective strategic ploy, tempting her to go wrong...as
she does on the next move.} 19...Bc6 $2 {now White has tactics involving the
light-square bishop and a revealed pin on the d-pawn.} ( 19...f5 {is one option
that would maintain the defense by blocking the b1-h7 diagonal and also the
further advance of the f-pawn. Perhaps Black did not like the resulting dark
square weaknesses, but these can be covered well enough by the Bf8. For example} 
20.Nf3 Bg7 $10 ) 20.Bh7 $1 $18 Rg7 21.Ne4 {unleashing multiple threats which
Black cannot parry.} 21...Qc7 22.Bb6 {this is a safe choice for consolidating
the advantage.} ( 22.Nxf6+ Kf7 23.f5 {is a more devastating but complex route.} 
) 22...dxe4 {essentially forced, getting some material back for the queen.} 
23.Bxc7 Rxh7 24.Bd6 Rg7 {getting back to a useful file with potential
counterplay. Black is no doubt hoping that the e-pawn plus more active pieces
gives her a chance to catch her opponent out in a tactic later.} 25.Rc1 {White
will be happy to exchange rooks on the c-file if Black allows it, consolidating
the material advantage.} 25...Nf5 $6 {allowing the exchange of bishops, which
reduces material and removes potential Black counterplay on the dark squares.} 
( 25...f5 $5 {consolidating the pawn structure seems useful here.} ) 26.Bxf8

simplifying the position further to a clear win.} 28...bxc6 29.Rxe6 {the
material balance is now queen and pawn for rook and knight, which without
counterplay is a win for White. Black tries a few more desperate moves, but has
no threats left.} 29...Ng3 30.Rxf6+ Ke7 31.Qc5+ {an elegant way to consolidate

1.Nf3 Nf6 2.g3 {going into the King's Indian Attack formation.} 2...d5 3.Bg2 g6 
{Black chooses a more symmetrical formation for her bishop development, although
she has already staked out territory in the center with ...d5.} 4.b3 {choosing a
double fianchetto approach and waiting to challenge in the center.} 4...Bg7 
5.Bb2 O-O 6.O-O a5 $5 {this is very commital with the a-pawn and of course does
nothing directly for Black's development. By following the usual rule of thumb
by reacting in the center to a wing advance, White may gain a slight advantage,
or at least an easier game.} 7.c4 c6 {logically reinforcing d5 and blunting the
White bishop on the long diagonal. However, it makes ...a5 look even more out of
place.} ( 7...dxc4 $6 {this might look attractive at the amateur level to some
players, but positionally White would effectively gain a central pawn. Also, the
half-open b-file is likely a strength, while White's isolated a-pawn can't
effectively be targeted by Black.} 8.bxc4 $14 ) 8.d3 {again choosing a more
restrained approach toward development, keeping options open in the center. The
main point is that the Nb1 will go to d2 rather than c3.} 8...Re8 {here ...a4 or
...Na6 are much more common in the database, which is to be expected, since they
are consistent with the ideas behind the earlier ...a5 advance. However, the
text move scores significantly better.} 9.Nbd2 ( 9.Qc2 $5 {is preferred by the
engine and scores much better in the database as well, although the text move is
more common. White waits to commit the knight and with the queen move clears the
d1 square for a rook, protects the Bb2, and exerts more control over e4, while
also establishing a presence on the c-file.} ) 9...Nbd7 10.Rc1 {improving the
rook and completing White's development. Black now plays the logical follow-up
to previous moves, seizing space in the center.} 10...e5 11.cxd5 {this is almost
obligatory, as otherwise Black can get an even stronger center. It also opens up
the file for the Rc1.} ( 11.e3 {would keep the tension in the center, but Black
has more space and better prospects.} ) 11...cxd5 {recapturing with the Nf6
would reduce the central pawn presence and give White a nice knight outpost on
c4.} 12.e4 ( 12.Rc2 {would be a more conventional and less commital choice, with
a slow buildup on the c-file possible.} ) 12...dxe4 {Black reacts by giving
White the type of game she evidently wants, rather than closing the center.} ( 
12...d4 {the advanced pawn cramps White, although not decisively after Nc4.} ) 
13.dxe4 b5 {taking away the c4 square from White's knight and gaining space.} 
14.Qc2 {overprotecting e4 and projecting power down the c-file.} 14...Ba6 
{clearing the c8 square for a rook, while also developing to a good diagonal.} 
15.h3 {while this takes away the g4 square from the Nf6, this seems like more of
a strategic waiting move.} 15...Bh6 {pinning the Nd2 and getting the bishop to a
more active diagonal.} 16.Qb1 $6 {this allows Black's queen to develop
effectively.} ( 16.Rfd1 $5 {and now if} 16...Qb6 17.Qc7 ) 16...Qb6 17.Rcd1 
{White now fully abandons the c-file, which seems unfortunate. However, Black
does not react strongly to it.} 17...Nh5 ( 17...Rad8 {would develop the rook to
a useful file, collectively making Black's pieces more stronger than White's;
for example ..Nc5 would be a strong follow-up.} ) 18.Rfe1 {clearing the square
for the knight to be redeveloped.} 18...Rad8 19.Nf1 {White improves her worst
piece.} 19...b4 20.Ne3 {an immediate logical follow-up, but this was not
necessarily urgent. The engine suggests Qa1 or Rd5 as other possibilities.} 
20...Bxe3 {Black profitably exchanges her bad bishop for good knight.} 21.Rxe3 
f6 {this logically reinforces e5 and makes White's pressure on the pawn
irrelevant, freeing up Black's pieces from protecting it. However, it takes away
a maneuver square for the Black knights.} ( 21...Nxg3 $5 {is an interesting
tactical possibility. The point is that the knight cannot be captured by the
f-pawn, which would leave the Re3 hanging.} 22.Nxe5 Nxe5 23.Rxg3 Rxd1+ 24.Qxd1 
f6 $10 ) 22.Nd2 $6 {this avoids the ...Nxg3 threat, since the Re3 now protects
the g-pawn, but White's pieces are placed awkwardly and the Nd2 interferes with
the Rd1. Black now exploits this.} ( 22.Nh2 ) 22...Nc5 23.Bf1 {needed to cover
the d3 square.} 23...Bb7 {an important strategic decision, done to avoid
exchanging bishops. Black may have felt that keeping the pressure on was more
important. However, e4 is overprotected and now White's knight goes to a
powerful square.} ( 23...Bxf1 24.Nxf1 $15 ) 24.Nc4 Qc7 25.Bg2 {logically
reinforcing e4, since d3 no longer needs to be covered.} ( 25.g4 $5 {is the

little premature.} ( 25...Rxd1+ {this is a recurring idea, swapping rooks and
getting Black's remaining rook to a good post on d8.} 26.Qxd1 Rd8 27.Qc2 Ng7 )

opponent. Black now must try to find a useful plan.} 26...Nge6 27.Ne3 {although
the knight looks good on c4, it will be even better on d5. Black has to think
about how to cover f6 now.} 27...Qf7 $6 {this unnecessarily defensive move
seriously reduces the scope of Black's queen.} ( 27...Ng5 {the engine's
alternative, but certainly not an obvious one for a human. The point being} 
28.Nd5 Qf7 {and now White has to protect the e-pawn with f3, otherwise for
example} 29.h4 ( 29.f3 Bxd5 30.exd5 Rxd5 {is at least equal for Black.} )

may only have a slight plus objectively, but now she has the initiative for the
first time.} 29...Rc8 30.Qb1 {getting the queen away from the line of fire of
the Rc8.} 30...Nc7 {Black needs to challenge the dominant Nd5.} 31.Nxc7 {here
the engine assesses that it's better for White to maintain the knight on d5, but
she may well have worried about maintaining an isolated d-pawn after an
exchange.} ( 31.h4 Nxd5 32.exd5 Red8 {leads to complicated play, with the engine
showing a slight plus for White.} ) 31...Rxc7 32.Bc1 {looking to redeploy to a
more active diagonal.} 32...Ne6 $6 {this in fact appears to be a less effective
square for the knight.} ( 32...a4 {is the active plan suggested by the engine.}

quite beneficial. Black fails to see this, however.} 34...Rxd5 $6 ( 34...Nd4

down a pawn, but has compensation in the form of the mobile passed d-pawn and
active pieces.} ) 35.exd5 Nd4 36.Qd1 {simply threatening to win a pawn by
exchanging on d4.} 36...Nb5 37.Bb6 $16 {and now White targets the weakness
created by Black's advanced a-pawn.} 37...Nc3 38.Qd2 Bb7 {unfortunately for

Black simply does not have compensation for the material, as White's rook will
be quite effective in the endgame. As often occurs with a major shift in game
evaluation, the player on the downward trend collapses.} 43...Bd5 $2 {now White
has a tactical finish, due to the inadequate protection of the bishop.} (

sacrifice. The point of the text move is that it now gives Black the possibility

1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Qb3 {this move does not have independent
significance versus Qc2 if Black takes on c4, as is most common in the database,

continuation is certainly consistent with the ideas behind the Slav Defense.} 
5.Qxc4 Bf5 {developing the bishop on its most effective diagonal.} 6.g3 {this is
by far the most common approach, with Nc3 the next choice. However as a Slav
player, I am always fine with my opponent developing on the long diagonal, since
the b7/c6 chain helps blunt the bishop.} 6...e6 {advancing now that the
light-square bishop is developed.} 7.Bg2 Be7 ( 7...Nbd7 {is played more often

Black, however after Bf4 White will have a space advantage, as in the game
continuation.} ) 12.axb3 {the trade-off here is that White gains the open a-file
in return for the doubled b-pawns. Sometimes this can be quite advantageous for
the player with the open file, other times it is less useful.} 12...Be4 {almost
always played here in the database. Black centralizes the bishop and prepares to
exchange more pieces.} 13.Bf4 Bd5 {this may be just a waiting move. Immediately
developing the rook with ...Rfc8 seems more useful.} 14.Rfc1 Rfc8 {Black must
have calculated the following exchange and judged it equal, since White
essentially forces the bishop for knight trade.} 15.Nd6 Bxd6 {otherwise Black
loses another tempo moving the rook and leaves the White knight on a dominating
square.} 16.Bxd6 Ne4 {looking to trade minor pieces again, in reverse.} 17.Ne5

knight to retreat to c5.} 20.Nc5 Kf7 {protecting e6. At this point, with a
double rook and minor piece ending, Black should feel comfortable about
maintaining an equal game. White's knight is better positioned, but there is not
enough material to sufficiently increase the pressure on Black's position.}

exchange it off for its counterpart. After this, however, the double rook ending
offers little scope for anything beyond a draw.} 26...Rd7 {more of a waiting
move than anything.} 27.Nc3 {hoping for an exchange, which would un-double the
pawns while still giving White the open a-file. Black smartly declines and
chooses to effectively shut down potential threats.} 27...a6 28.Nxb5 axb5 {this

current material on the board.} 29.Ke4 {White attempts to be aggressive.}

1.Nf3 d5 2.g3 g6 3.Bg2 {technically speaking, it's not too late after this to
transpose to an English with c4 or a Queen's Pawn opening, but generally this
means White intends to go for the full King's Indian Attack.} 3...Bg7 {Black
chooses to develop the bishop and then put the knight on e7 instead of f6.} 
4.O-O e5 {Black already has a small edge (around 2 percent) in the database in
this line. One problem with the KIA, versus the KID for Black, is that Black in
the KIA can better pursue a pattern of development that minimizes White's
strengths, since White has committed early to the formation.} 5.d3 Ne7 {from
here the knight reinforces d5 and helps control f5, while not obstructing the
Bg7 in its protection of e5.} 6.Nbd2 O-O 7.e4 {and now we have reached the
standard KIA setup for White.} 7...c6 ( 7...Nbc6 $5 {scores much better in the
database and is also the most popular. The text move reinforces d5 and blunts
the long diagonal, but is worse for black's minor piece development.} ) 8.Re1 
{continuing the standard moves.} 8...Qd6 {the queen is a little too vulnerable
in the center here.} ( 8...d4 {is most played here, locking the center. If c3,
then ...c5 will maintain the structure.} ) ( 8...Qc7 {is the second most popular
and generally played if Black wishes to move the queen. The text move has very
few examples.} ) 9.c3 $14 {this supports either the d4 or b4 pawn advance, with
d4 being the general plan. Also, now Black cannot play ...d4 to good effect,
since the pawn can be immediately exchanged off there. White possesses has a
small advantage, with a clear plan of disrupting the center, while Black must
struggle to complete her development.} 9...f5 {a thematic pawn lever in a KID,
somewhat ironically, but it is not good here, as Black's center is too weak and
a key diagonal to her king is opened. However, White reacts with a similarly
stereotypical move in response.} 10.d4 {not bad in itself, but it lets Black get
back on even footing in the center.} ( 10.b4 {is Komodo Dragon's preference,
seizing space on the queenside with a solid central presence. Black has little
productive she can do, and the exchange on e4 or pushing the pawn to f4 are
better for White. For example:} 10...fxe4 ( 10...f4 11.Qb3 $18 {and Black's
center will collapse under pressure.} ) 11.dxe4 dxe4 12.Ng5 $18 {and White will
now regain the pawn with a large positional advantage against the isolated
e-pawn, as well as Qb3 to come against the open a2-g8 diagonal.} ) 10...fxe4 
11.Nxe5 Bxe5 $6 {this seems like a hasty choice. The problem is that it leaves
Black vulnerable on the dark squares, without the bishop to cover them.} ( 
11...Nd7 ) 12.dxe5 Qxe5 13.f3 $16 {a safe choice for the advantage, pressuring
and dissolving Black's center. Komodo Dragon finds a more tactical blow:} ( 
13.Nxe4 dxe4 14.Bh6 {now Black has to give up the exchange.} 14...Nd7 ( 
14...Re8 $2 15.Rxe4 Qd5 16.Qe2 Qf7 17.Re1 $18 ) 15.Bxf8 Nxf8 16.Rxe4 Qf6 
17.Qb3+ Kg7 18.Rae1 Nf5 $16 ) 13...Qf6 {getting the queen out of the sights of
the Re1.} 14.Kh1 {another slower and more prudent move. Now Black could do
better by developing a piece, for example with ...Be6, but instead opens things
up to her detriment.} ( 14.Qe2 $5 ) 14...exf3 $6 15.Nxf3 Nf5 $18 {resolutely
continuing not to develop her bishop. Now White can move onto the attack and the
engine already shows a winning advantage.} ( 15...Bg4 ) 16.Bg5 {now all of
White's pieces are in effective play, while Black has three stuck at home and an
unfilled gap around her king.} 16...Qg7 17.Qd2 h6 {Black successfully drives
back the bishop, but leaves further holes behind.} 18.Bf4 g5 19.Be5 
{beautifully centralized and demonstrating just how badly Black is missing her
dark-square bishop and f-pawn.} 19...Qg6 20.c4 $1 {an outstanding, master-level
idea. This clears the c3 square for the bishop in the event it is challenged
with ...Nd7 and thereby maintains White's dominant piece.} 20...Be6 {nothing
better. Contrast the effectiveness of the two bishops. White now continues the
attack and ignores the threat to the c-pawn.} 21.g4 {driving the defending
knight away to an awkward square. The g-pawn is of course weak, but Black cannot
take advantage of this.} 21...Ne7 {now White has several tactical ideas based on
the hanging Ne7 and pressure down the e-file.} 22.Qb4 {good enough, but not the
most effective follow-up. If Black had gotten another piece into the game with
...Nd7, perhaps play could have continued.} ( 22.Bc3 $5 {with the idea of Qd4} 
) ( 22.Bxb8 Raxb8 23.Nd4 {wins material.} ) 22...c5 23.Qxc5 {munching the free
pawn.} 23...Nbc6 24.Nd4 ( 24.Bc3 {would give White similar tactical
possibilities while preserving the outstanding bishop, but the text move is
certainly good enough.} ) 24...Bxg4 25.Bd6 b6 {Black's best practical chance,
but White finds the correct continuation.} ( 25...Nxd4 26.Rxe7 Ne6 27.Qxd5 $18 
) 26.Nxc6 $1 {and White will be up too much material after ...bxc5 and Nxe7+} 1-0

obviously a lot of transposition possibilities.} ) 3...d6 4.Be3 {White
super-focuses on reinforcing d4.} 4...Nd7 5.Nc3 a6 {the Modern is not about
taking on White directly, but restricting potential activity. Black here takes
away the b5 square, for example.} 6.a4 {restraining ...b5 in turn.} 6...b6

8th, Ningbo (3.4), 2011.07.19} ) 8...Bb7 9.Bg5 Ndf6 {this looks strange, but the
point is to develop the other knight to e7, from where it can fight for d5 and
f5.} 10.Qe2 {after this, the engine considers the position completely even, with
perhaps a slight advantage to Black. White retreats her pieces, meaning the
previous development was largely ineffective.} 10...h6 11.Bh4 {choosing to
maintain the bishop's presence on the kingside. Bd2 seems more flexible.} 
11...g5 {a commital move, with the intent of forcing a piece trade. A more
standard developing alternative would be ...Ne7.} 12.Bg3 Nh5 13.O-O-O {the best
place for the king, as O-O would then give more punch to Black's trade on g3,
with prospects for further kingside pawn advances to open up the position.} 
13...Ne7 14.Ne1 {forcing Black to commit with the Nh5. However, this was
presumably her intent anyway with the knight, so perhaps something more active
is indicated.} ( 14.d5 $5 {Black's king is still in the center and White's rook
is now in play on d1, so this seems like a good time to advance.} ) 14...Nxg3 
15.hxg3 {the usual rule of capturing towards the center applies in this
position. White maintains a connected pawn formation and usefully opens the
h-file for the rook.} 15...Qd7 {developing the queen and clearing the back rank
for possible queenside castling.} 16.d5 {this ends up being a premature break in
the center. White has just retreated the knight, so her forces are not fully
marshaled to support her in the center.} ( 16.f4 $5 {is the engine's
preference.} ) 16...exd5 17.Nxd5 {with the game continuation, this seems fine,
but the engine suggests that Black is better without further exchanges on d5.}

much worse and Black will also be able to take over the initiative in the
center, for example after ...Rfe8 and ...d5.} ) ( 17...O-O {also looks good.} ) 
18.Bxd5 Nxd5 19.exd5+ Kf8 {Black is still equal here, despite having lost the
right to castle. Material is reduced, lessening the chance of a kingside attack
succeeding for White, and Black has good prospects on the queenside.} 20.Qe4 
{actively centralizing the queen.} 20...Re8 {logically kicking the queen off of
the excellent e4 square, but it still moves to another good square.} 21.Qc4 b5 
{forcing the opening of lines on the queenside.} 22.axb5 {necessary to avoid the
opening of the b-file after ...bxa4, which would increase the vulnerability of
the White king.} 22...axb5 23.Qb3 $6 {this is too passive a square for the
queen.} ( 23.Qc6 ) 23...Ra8 24.Nd3 {White correctly ignores the possibility of a
check on a1, which would gain Black nothing, as she is not in a position to
effectively go after White's king on d2. The knight needs to get back in the
game.} 24...Bf6 {clearing g7 for the king.} 25.f3 {this fights for g4 and also
ensures the f-pawn is protected by another pawn, otherwise it could be pressured
after ...Qf5 in some lines.} 25...Kg7 {now Black's rooks are connected.} ( 
25...h5 {is the engine's suggestion, a prophylactic move against what White
plays next.} ) 26.g4 {the logical follow-up, controlling f5 and h5 and blocking
further advances of Black's pawns.} 26...c5 {another commital pawn move by
Black. This will result in a half-open c-file, but Black's pawn structure is
weakened.} 27.dxc6 Qxc6 28.c3 {now it seems more evident that Black does not
have enough attacking potential against the White king.} 28...Qb6 {putting the
queen on a more useful diagonal and threatening ...Qe3+} 29.Kc2 Rac8 $6 {it
seems counterintuitive to leave the open a-file, reducing the number of
potential threats Black could try to make. Moving the other rook to c8 is
preferred by the engine.} 30.Nb4 {White's knight now greatly improves its
scope.} 30...Be5 {defending the d-pawn and getting on the better b8-h2
diagonal.} 31.Nd5 Qa7 32.Rd2 {allowing for possibly doubling rooks on the
d-file, while covering the 2nd rank.} ( 32.Qxb5 $2 {pawn snatching here in fact
does open too many lines against White's king.} 32...Rb8 33.Qd3 Qa2 34.Rb1 Rhc8

target after ...Rc5, which then gives Black additional threats against White's
king position.} ) 32...Rb8 33.Re1 Rhc8 $6 {this looks very reasonable, but now
White continues with her rook lift idea.} ( 33...b4 {is found by the engine. It
is counter-intuitive, since it looks like it just loses a pawn.} 34.Nxb4 Rb5

with the ability to double major pieces on either the a- or b-files.} ) 34.Re4

progress on the queenside.} 34...Kh7 35.Nb4 {while the knight looked good on d5,
it lacked targets. Note that the a2-g8 diagonal is also now open for the queen,
pressuring f7.} 35...Rc5 $2 {while in some earlier variations this rook move
would have made sense, here its awkward placement will cause immediate problems
for Black.} ( 35...Kg6 {Black needs to think defensively and this would protect
f7.} ) 36.Nd3 {Black now has no good moves with the rook.} 36...Rc4 ( 36...Rc7

now goes for a Slav Defense structure with a fianchetto, which is called the
Schlechter variation. However, the opening can be reached by different paths and
can be classified in various ways.} 5.Be2 d5 6.O-O O-O 7.Nc3 {for example, this
is now classified as a Grunfeld Defense, Burille Variation by the Chess.com
Explorer, while the PGN download of the game calls it a King's Indian, East
Indian Defence (ECO code A48). The key points of the structure, regardless, of
how it is classified, is that White has developed with e3/Be2 instead of
fianchettoing the bishop, while Black has the c6/d5 pawns and has fianchettoed
her dark-square bishop.} 7...Ne4 {another relatively rare move. Black moves the
same piece twice before developing further, which is against general opening

active than the text move, placing the queen on the more useful b-file and a2-g8
diagonal.} ) 8...Nxc3 {Black chooses a safe and somewhat passive route.} ( 
8...Bf5 $5 {is a more interesting and active choice. However, Black would need
to be prepared to have an uglier pawn structure.} 9.Bd3 Nxc3 10.Bxf5 gxf5 ( 
10...Nxa2 $6 11.Rxa2 gxf5 12.Qxf5 e6 13.Qh3 {and now that White's queen has been
freely transferred to the kingside, it may only be a small advantage according
to the engine, but White certainly has the easier game and more winning
chances.} ) 11.bxc3 e6 12.Ba3 Re8 13.cxd5 cxd5 14.c4 {with a slight edge for
White.} ) 9.bxc3 {the doubled pawns are only temporary, as the c4 pawn can
always be exchanged for the d5 pawn.} 9...e6 {trying to be ultra-solid,
apparently. First time this has appeared in the database, with ...b6 and ...dxc4
previously played.} 10.Ba3 {certainly a very logical way to develop the bishop,
as the diagonal is excellent and it has nowhere else useful to go. Komodo Dragon
prefers plans involving an a4 pawn push, exploiting White's space advantage on
the queenside and further restricting Black.} 10...Re8 11.Rab1 $14 {putting the
rook on the half-open file and restraining Black's b-pawn from advancing to b5.
By this point White's advantage in development has given her a small but
persistent plus.} 11...Nd7 12.cxd5 {this may be a little premature and also
helps un-cramp Black's structure to some degree. However, White still has a
freer game afterwards.} ( 12.h3 $5 {is an interesting prophylactic idea by the
engine, the idea being to prevent an eventual ...Bg4.} ) 12...exd5 13.c4 dxc4 
{this abdicates Black's central pawn presence without a fight.} ( 13...Nb6 
14.cxd5 cxd5 {is the engine's preference, ending up in an IQP position. This may
have been what turned Black off to the idea.} ) 14.Bxc4 {White's lead in
development and positional plus is obvious. The two bishops have excellent
diagonals and the Rb1 is well-placed. That said, White does not have any
immediate threats.} 14...Nb6 {clearing the way to develop the Bc8 and kick the
Bc4.} 15.Bd3 Be6 ( 15...Bg4 {seems more natural, threatening to exchange off the
knight and compromise White's kingside pawn structure.} ) 16.Bc5 {increasing
pressure on the queenside.} ( 16.Rfc1 $5 {getting the other rook into play might
be better first.} ) 16...Qc7 {this seems like a normal move, protecting b7 and
connecting the rooks, but there are lurking issues with it.} ( 16...Nd7 17.Rxb7 
Nxc5 18.dxc5 Re7 {is a pawn sacrifice suggested by the engine, where Black now
has the two bishops and a freer game in compensation. If eventually a 4v3 pawn
rook endgame is reached, it could be drawn.} ) 17.Ng5 {looking to obtain the two
bishops after a piece exchange.} 17...Bc8 {awkward, but the best way of
preventing the exchange.} 18.Ne4 {Eyeing the weak d6 square. White has a
comfortable game and a positional plus, with better control of the center and
more active pieces.} 18...Nd5 19.Rfc1 ( 19.Nd6 $5 {White could continue the
previous idea and force the piece exchange now. However, with the text move she
keeps her own centralized knight.} ) 19...Rd8 {regaining control over d6.} 
20.a4 {not having an obvious way to make further progress, White decides to grab
some space.} ( 20.h3 {is again a prophylactic idea.} ) ( 20.Rb3 $5 {would allow
for potential doubling of the rooks on the b-file and also prevent a tactical
idea of Black's, as we can see in the next variation.} ) 20...Bf5 {the bishop
re-activates itself.} ( 20...b6 $5 {is the tactical idea.} 21.Ba3 Bf5 {Black can
allow capture of the c-pawn, due to the pin on the Ne4 once the queen is gone.}

Rxe4 $10 ) 21.Ba3 {without the Nb6 as a target, the bishop was not doing as
much, so retreats.} 21...Rab8 {Black does not find the ...b6 idea and more
passively defends.} 22.Rb2 ( 22.Rb3 {seems like a better placement, providing
protection along the third rank.} ) 22...a5 {this freezes the White a-pawn and
gives Black a potential outpost on b4. However, as with all pawn advances, it
leaves some weaknesses behind.} 23.h3 {restricting the Bf5.} ( 23.Nc3 {an
alternative would be to initiate exchanges and highlight White's pressure on the
queenside.} 23...Bxd3 24.Qxd3 Nxc3 25.Qxc3 $14 ) 23...h5 {preventing g2-g4, but
again leaving some holes behind.} ( 23...b6 $5 ) 24.Nc5 {now one pair of pieces
are exchanged.} 24...Bxd3 25.Qxd3 Bf8 {putting the bishop on a better diagonal.} 
26.Qb1 {it might have been more flexible for the queen's placement to use Rc1-b1
to double on the file. This would also help deter Black from opening the
b-file.} 26...Qc8 {the point of this move is to cover the a6 square to allow
Black's b-pawn to advance, otherwise there would be a knight fork on a6.} 
27.Qa2 {this protects the Ba3.} 27...b5 {now Black finally gets some counterplay
rolling, although if anything White still has a slight edge.} 28.axb5 $6 {this
immediate resolution of the tension is unnecessary and makes Black's queenside
pawns much more threatening. White may have been uncomfortable with the threat
of ...b4, but Black will have that possibility anyway.} 28...cxb5 29.Nd3 $6 
{now Black firmly takes the initiative, exploiting White's cramped pieces.} ( 
29.Rbc2 ) 29...Nc3 30.Qa1 ( 30.Rxc3 $5 {Komodo Dragon favors this exchange
sacrifice, leaving White more active after} 30...Qxc3 31.Ne5 Qc7 32.Bxf8 $15 
{with threats to f7, g6 and a fork on c6 helping White regain the initiative,
even if down material.} ) 30...b4 $19 {although Black does not immediately win
the Ba3, White is in serious trouble.} 31.Rbc2 Qf5 {targeting the hanging Nd3
and moving out of the pin on the c-file. Now White avoids losing material, but
Black gets a rook on the 2nd rank, with a stranglehold on the position.} 32.Ne5 
bxa3 33.Rxc3 Rb2 {the most immediate threat is to f2, but the advanced a-pawn
combined with Black's rooks is also a major problem.} 34.Rf1 Rdb8 35.Nd3 Rd2 ( 
35...Bb4 {would more aggressively activate the bishop.} 36.Nxb2 Bxc3 37.Qxa3

material.} 38.Rxa3 Bxa3 39.Qxa3 Qb5 40.Qe7 {the best try. White hopes to combine
her queen and knight and take advantage of the weak square complex around
Black's king.} 40...a4 {Black goes with the straightforward plan of ramming the
a-pawn down the file.} 41.d5 {an excellent practical move by White, who must
have hoped to distract Black, and succeeds. The engine shows White cannot queen
the d-pawn, but it must have looked menacing.} 41...Qxd5 $2 ( 41...Rb1 42.Rxb1 
Qxb1+ 43.Kh2 Qb8+ 44.d6 Qf8 {and Black wins.} ) 42.Qe8+ {now White is back in
business, forking the a-pawn with her active queen.} 42...Kg7 43.Qxa4 {White now
has high hopes for a draw, with a pawn for the exchange and a reasonable
position.} 43...Ra2 44.Qf4 ( 44.Qd4+ Qxd4 45.Nxd4 {after simplification there
seems little prospect for a Black breakthrough. Perhaps White did not trust her
endgame skills, however.} ) 44...Qc4 45.Qe5+ $10 {the engine evaluates the
position as equal. For Black, though, there is no reason not to play on, as long
as she is careful not to blunder.} 45...f6 46.Qe7+ Qf7 47.Qd6 Qc7 48.Qd5 Ra5

which has better access to her opponent's king.} 52.Qd1 {perhaps hoping for a
repetition. However, Black is not interested.} 52...Kh6 53.Qb1 Qa8 54.Qb6 {an
inaccuracy. This is a characteristic of queen endings especially, where both
sides can go astray more easily.} ( 54.Qb4 Rg5 55.Nf3 Qxf3 56.Qf8+ {and draws.}

preferred by the engine, with the idea of following up with ...g5 and ...Kg6, to
work Black's space advantage and increase the pressure. With the queens off the
board, Black has nothing to fear.} ) 57.Nd4 Rbb2 {looking to safely tie up White
with pressure along the 2nd rank, but Black has nowhere to go from there.}

her pawns.} 59.g3 ( 59.Ne6+ Kf7 60.Nf4 $10 {White's knight is very active and

1.c4 f5 2.g3 Nf6 3.Bg2 g6 {committing to the Leningrad Dutch formation.} 4.b3

Black counterpart on the long diagonal, including for the key square e5.} 
4...Bg7 5.Bb2 O-O 6.Nf3 d6 7.d4 {White finally commits her pawn to d4, but only
after Black was threatening to get in ...e5. We now have a reasonably standard
Leningrad Dutch position, where White has chosen an early b3/Bb2 development
scheme.} 7...Ne4 {This is the third most played choice in the database, although
the standard ...c6 and ...Qe8 are more popular. It doesn't score very well for
Black, though, and seems premature.} 8.Nbd2 {the usual location for this knight
in the variation, leaving the Bb2 unblocked.} 8...c5 {Black challenges the
center, but is falling behind in development.} ( 8...Nc6 $5 ) 9.Qc2 {the usual
spot for the queen, protecting b2 and pressuring e4.} 9...cxd4 {this exchange
helps White, who has everything covered and more pieces developed.} 10.Nxd4 Qb6 
11.e3 {a solid choice preserving White's central edge and restraining f5-f4.} ( 
11.Nxe4 $5 {is the engine's preference and here seems a relatively simple path
to advantage, limiting Black's counterplay. The knight is inadequately supported
on e4, a fact which informs the next few moves of the game.} 11...Bxd4 ( 
11...fxe4 {this cedes the pawn for no real compensation.} 12.Qxe4 Qa5+ 13.Kf1 
$16 {the White king is well-protected and the Rh1 can still participate in the
game by supporting an h-pawn push.} ) 12.Bxd4 Qxd4 13.Nc3 $16 {and after some
straightforward exchanges, White has a significant lead in development and
active play in both the center and kingside against Black's weak squares.} ) 
11...e5 {the rule in the Leningrad Dutch is to play ...e5 whenever Black can get
away with it. Here it is a little premature, because of the unstable Ne4.} ( 
11...Nf6 {the engine assesses the knight retreat is best.} ) 12.Nb5 {this avoids
complications and leaves White with a small plus.} ( 12.Nxe4 {immediately still
works, but is messier than in the previous variation, since now the Nd4 is
attacked by a pawn.} 12...exd4 13.Ng5 {and now} 13...dxe3 $2 {looks dangerous,
but it is Black that is in trouble after something like} 14.Bd5+ Kh8 15.O-O-O

defended against, so Black will have to give up the exchange.} ) 12...a6 {the
obvious choice, kicking the knight.} 13.Nxe4 {now White pulls the trigger on the
Ne4.} 13...axb5 14.Nc3 bxc4 15.Nd5 {an excellent outpost for the knight.}

knight and blocking White's tactical ideas along the diagonal.} 17.O-O Nc6

the backward d6 pawn.} 18...Rf7 {the immediate ...e4 may have been better,
waiting to commit the rook to a course of action.} 19.b4 {White intends to
mobilize her queenside pawn majority.} 19...e4 {cutting off the Bg2 and opening
up the long diagonal.} 20.Bxg7 {the exchange is best, as otherwise White will
have to take time to defend the bishop.} 20...Kxg7 21.a4 {White could have done
some other things here, for example immediately reactivating the bishop with
Bf1. The engine points out a nice tactical maneuver possibility by Black that
could have lead to equality, in response.} 21...Ne5 $6 {now White's queen gets
out of the pin and is still powerfully centralized.} ( 21...Qf6 $5 {the point
being that} 22.Nxf6 Bxc4 23.Nd5 Bb3 {and Black is fine, being able to
effectively trade the weak d-pawn for one of White's queenside pawns. Otherwise,
Black as a follow-up can play ...Qe5 and/or trade on d5 and be equal.} ) 22.Qd4

is getting cramped defending her weaknesses.} 24.Bf1 Qg5 $6 {superficially
aggressive but Black does not have an attack. White calmly defends, allowing
Black to overcommit her forces, then strikes back in the center and queenside.}

first rank to be cleared.} 27...Rc8 28.Rd2 {intending to double rooks on the
d-file.} ( 28.Rac1 {seems more straightforward. Exchanging off a pair of rooks
would be advantageous to White, who will have a winning 2-1 queenside majority
in the endgame. If Black avoids the trade, then White has the file and can start
pushing the pawns anyway.} ) 28...Qf7 29.Qd4 {White has the better queen so
avoids the trade.} 29...Qf6 30.Rad1 d5 {at least this gives Black a little more
room for maneuver.} 31.a5 ( 31.b5 $5 {would prevent ...Nc6.} ) 31...Rcd8 $2

solves some of Black's problems in the center. For example} 32.Qb6 Ne7 $14 {and
Black is close to equality, as the knight can hold d5 by itself, freeing up both
rooks.} ) 32.b5 {now the Ne5 is out of the important central fight.} 32...Nf7

queen, Black cannot take twice on d5.} 38...Rxd5 39.Rxd5 Ra8 40.Rc5 Nxa7 41.Ra5

attack the Ra8.} 41...Kh6 42.Ra6 Kg7 43.Bc4 Rc8 44.Rxa7+ Kf6 {the game is now a
theoretical win for White. Black knows that it still takes practical skill to
win the R+B v R ending, so she keeps playing. Krush is up for it, however.}

beginning to get cramped.} 54...Ra1 55.Rb1 {naturally Black has zero chances if
she gives up the rook.} ( 55.Rb7+ {it's interesting to see how White could have
been more aggressive if she chose. The problem for Black is that her king is

of the g5 pawn on the kingside and follow a queenside strategy, as the h/g pawn
duo cannot break through. However, White chooses to focus on the kingside, with
diastrous results.} 22.f4 $2 {now Black can open up the game to her great
benefit, with the f4 square as the pivot.} 22...gxf4 23.gxf4 exf4 24.e5 {White

opportunity.} 28.Ne4 f5 {controlling e4, although Black has to be a little
careful not to take prematurely.} 29.d6 {White's last hope. This opens the long
diagonal and makes possible a bishop fork on e4, of the Ng6 and Ra8. Black
therefore calmly eliminates the tactic.} 29...c6 30.Bb6 {White has nothing left
except to harass Black's queen temporarily.} 30...Qh4 31.Bf2 Qh5 32.Qd3 (

solid choice by White, but should not pose any problems for Black after the

opening.} 4...dxc4 5.Qxc4 Bf5 6.g3 e6 7.Bg2 Be7 8.O-O Nbd7 9.e3 O-O {a standard
Slav-type position has been reached that is comfortable for Black. White still

diagonal (d1-h5).} 10...h6 {here the engines like ... Bg6, with full equality.
Black is in no rush to commit the rooks or pawns and by retreating the bishop,
the sting is taken out of a potential future e4 push by White. The text move is
just fine, though.} 11.Nc3 Ne4 12.Nd2 {forcing the trade, to get rid of the
well-placed knight.} 12...Nxd2 13.Bxd2 {White completes her minor piece
development and will look to push with e4 and/or activate her rooks.} 13...e5

that after} 15.e4 Bg4 $11 {is possible, pushing the White queen around or
forcing the awkward f2-f3 push blocking the Bg2.} ) 15.Nxd5 $16 Bd6 {this bishop
is "bad" and the Nd5 is clearly superior to it. However, White now unnecessarily
retreats the knight. Activating the rooks seems more to the point.} 16.Nc3 $6 (

doubled rooks on the c-file, there is no actual threat associated with this
move, so it is less effective than in earlier variations.} 23...Qd7 24.Rd1 Rxc2

pawn on e4.} ( 27.Rc1 Qxc1+ 28.Qxc1 Rxc1+ 29.Bxc1 Nc5 {can only benefit Black,

e-pawns and covering the c-file.} 28...Qa5 29.a3 {both protecting the a-pawn and
covering the b4 square.} 29...Bb3 {while the position is objectively equal, the
initiative has shifted to Black, who keeps making threats and puts White in a
reactive mode.} 30.Rc1 Rd8 {lining up on the queen.} 31.Qe2 Bc5 {Black would be
fine with an exchange that put her knight on c5.} 32.Bd2 {White appears to have
everything covered, but Black continues to apply pressure with} 32...Bc4

Black's favor.} 33.Qe1 {White's pieces are all now on the first three ranks,
showing how little progress has been made.} 33...Bxf1 34.Kxf1 Qa6+ 35.Kg2 {this
preserves the material balance.} ( 35.Qe2 Qxe2+ 36.Kxe2 Bxf2 37.b4 {is the

1.c4 c6 2.Nf3 d5 3.e3 Nf6 4.Nc3 e6 5.b3 {this is in keeping with the flank
opening approach and significantly more popular than playing for a pawn center
with d4, although both have a similar winning percentage in the database.} 
5...Nbd7 6.Bb2 Bd6 {in keeping with the Semi-Slav structure Black has adopted.
The bishop helps control e5 and is on the more active b8-h2 diagonal. However it
also blocks the d-file for the Qd8 and is hanging until the Nd7 moves, which can
sometimes be taken advantage of tactically.} 7.Qc2 {the best square for the
queen, getting on the b1-h7 diagonal, protecting the Bb2, eyeing the c-file
should it open up, and clearing the first rank for the Ra1 to move.} 7...O-O 
8.Rg1 {indicative of the modern approach to openings, in which once a plan is
selected - in this case a kingside pawn storm - it is carried out at once. Rg1
can also be played in an accelerated fashion as early as move 5.} 8...Re8 
{Black now goes for passive defense, rather than countering in the center in a
classical fashion with ...e5. The text move is not bad, but the the follow-up
gives White too much scope on the kingside.} 9.g4 {White has committed and must
launch the pawn.} 9...Nf8 $2 ( 9...e5 ) 10.g5 $16 N6d7 11.h4 {the most
straightforward way to continue the kingside pawn storm. O-O-O would be an
interesting possibility, getting the other rook into play.} 11...a6 {Black
attempts to get counterplay against White's queenside and get her Bc8
developed.} 12.h5 ( 12.d4 {is preferred by the engine, proactively fighting for
e5. While it looks like this shuts in the Bb2, Black could do this otherwise by
advancing ...e5 herself.} ) 12...b5 {the most disruptive move.} 13.Bd3 {White
decides to avoid advancing the d-pawn and instead develop the bishop. Without
the central pawn, however, Black will have ...e5 as a resource.} 13...Bb7 14.g6

she misses a sacrificial motif.} ( 14.Bxh7+ Nxh7 15.Nxb5 {this is the key idea,
opening the long diagonal and threatening the Bd6, not giving Black time enough
to shore up kingside defenses.} 15...Ndf8 ( 15...axb5 16.g6 {with similar play.}

against the king, with g6 a weak square despite the presence of the Nf8.}

uncoordinated, the king is perfectly safe here.} 24.Ba3 c5 $1 {Black hits on the
correct idea immediately, to mobilize her pawns. Black's pieces now coordinate
much more effectively against the White king.} 25.Rb1 d4 $19 {perhaps White
underestimated the power of this pawn break, which breaks open the White pawn
shield and opens up the long diagonal as well. Now there are no good options.}

Eswaran-Lee. Black is going to play differently, emphasizing controlling and
occupying the e5 square.} 6.Bb2 O-O 7.Be2 {White's setup so far is standard in
this line.} 7...e5 {this forces White into making a defining choice about the
center.} 8.cxd5 {the principled exchange, also played in the vast majority of
database games. The point of flank play is to create a target in the center that
can be attacked/undermined, and exchanging off a supporting pawn advances that
goal.} 8...cxd5 9.Nb5 {universally played here. Black's bishop is significantly
better than White's knight in general, and is supporting the key e5 pawn, so
exchanging it makes strategic sense.} 9...Nc6 {choosing to maintain the pawn on
e5.} 10.Nxd6 Qxd6 11.O-O {this postpones any decision-making regarding the

presence in the center and also forces Black to define intentions in the
center.} 11...e4 12.Ne5 {and White is fine, as} 12...Qb4+ $6 13.Qd2 {just helps
White develop, since the king would be quite safe on d2 after an exchange.} )

development, since there is no resulting pin on the Nf3 and Black then wastes
time by not exchanging the minor pieces immediately.} ( 11...Bf5 $5 ) 12.h3 Bh5

passive strategy, seeing if Black will commit to something erroneous.} ( 13.Nd4

tactically by the Q+B battery against the Bh5.} 13...Bxe2 14.Nxe2 {and now White

looks good on the advanced central square, but this is premature. The queen

light-square bishop's early development by targeting b7.} 8...Qc7 {this has
generally replaced ...Qb6 as standard. In top level master games White was
consistently able to obtain a small plus and grind it after Nxg6. For Class
players, it probably doesn't matter.} 9.Bd2 Be7 10.O-O-O {this is the first big
decision for White in the line, determining the middlegame's characteristic.
Here White decides to castle long, since the kingside is not in such great shape
and it makes for a more dynamic game with opposite-side castling.} 10...dxc4

safer.} ) ( 10...O-O {looks like a normal move but is rarely played. It makes it
relatively easy for White to play against in the middlegame, using kingside pawn
thrusts.} ) 11.Bxc4 a6 {the database and engines show equal results for Black at
this point. With the d/c pawns exchanged, White lacks any near-term pawn levers
and Black has a solid and harmonious position.} 12.Nxg6 {clearly a better trade
for White, given the knight has so few squares.} 12...hxg6 {however Black
remains very solid and still has not committed to castling, so the h-file is
covered by the rook.} 13.Ne4 b5 ( 13...Nxe4 {is probably a quicker way toward a

eventually play for a win rather than head for a draw.} 15.Kb1 {this is almost
always a useful move with a queenside-castled king, covering a2 - although here
the Qb3 does that as well - and clearing c1 for a rook in the future.} 15...Rc8

her c-pawn lever plan.} ( 16.Nxf6+ Nxf6 17.g3 $10 ) 16...c5 17.Bg3 Qc6 {it is

response by Black, who however will need to immediately exchange bishop for
knight, as the bishop retreat after h3 is not as effective. This is not a bad

able to build a strong pawn skeleton on the light squares.} 4.h3 Bxf3 5.Qxf3 e6

the obvious next move to occupy the center and free the Bc1.} ( 7...Bc5 $5 {is
the next most popular and scores slightly better in the database. The point of
course is to prevent d4.} ) 8.d4 dxe4 {Black needs to exchange in the center,
otherwise White's presence becomes too strong.} 9.Nxe4 Nxe4 10.Qxe4 Nf6 11.Qd3 
{the situation in the center is now more resolved, with a standard Caro-Kann
pawn structure for both sides and White having the two bishops, a slight
long-term advantage.} 11...Qc7 {the queen move is logical, since it occupies the
h2-b8 diagonal and at least temporarily prevents White developing with Bf4.
However, it may be a premature commitment of Black's strongest piece.} ( 
11...Be7 {is most played here, as the logical square for the bishop and to
immediately prepare kingside castling.} ) 12.Rd1 {the best file for the rook,
supporting the d-pawn again and therefore allowing the Qd3 more flexibility.}

attantion on the queenside. The easiest and best response appears to be simply
to block further progress of the a-pawn and restrain the White b-pawn's
advance.} 13...a5 14.Bd2 {it is not easy for White to find a good square for
this bishop and it is awkwardly transferred here to e1.} 14...O-O 15.Be1 Rfd8

game is equal.} 16.Qc4 {neither side has obvious weaknesses to target, so the
middlegame will necessarily feature some maneuvering. Black's plan is easier to
identify, however: doubling rooks on the d-file and threatening a pawn break to
open it up. The text move is not bad for White, but it does put the queen in the
way of the c-pawn.} 16...Rd7 17.Bf3 {the bishop was not doing much on the other
diagonal, so f3 is a better square for it.} 17...Rad8 18.c3 {logically
reinforcing d4. Also, White has little better.} 18...e5 {Nimzovich famously
wrote "the threat is stronger than the execution" - which seems true here. Black
is fine after the resulting exchanges, but could have maintained the tension.}

better, however.} ( 21...Rxd1 22.Rxd1 Rxd1 23.Bxd1 Kf8 $10 ) 22.g3 {controlling
the f4 square.} 22...Bf6 {this restrains the advance of White's b-pawn, but
gives up its mobility along the f8-a3 diagonal and leaves the bishop biting on
the c3 pawn.} 23.Bf3 {returning to its previous square, but now it appears less
effective.} ( 23.Bg4 $5 ) 23...Nb6 {now we get another exchange in any case.}

afterwards.} 25.Ra2 {this appears to be a waiting move, to see what Black will
do.} 25...Ne5 26.Be2 Nd3 {forcing the minor piece exchange. White can choose
which bishop, however.} 27.Bxd3 Rxd3 28.Ra3 {from this point the position is
very balanced, with near- symmetrical pawn structures. Black has better piece
activity, but there is no way to make real progress.} ( 28.Ra1 $5 ) 28...Be7

1.e4 c5 2.Nc3 d6 {the #2 reply in the database, but far behind ...Nc6, which (at
this stage) scores above 50% for Black. The added control over d4 seems more
important than preventing an early e4-e5, the usual reason for playing ...d6.} 
( 2...Nc6 3.f4 g6 {is the preferred method for Black players to handle the Grand
Prix Attack.} ) 3.f4 {historically by playing g3 here we would enter a Closed
Sicilian, but the Grand Prix Attack is now more popular.} 3...g6 {the Grand Prix
Attack proper would be entered by transposition with ...Nc6. Here with ...g6,
Black chooses to accelerate the dark-square bishop development to influence the
center and also contest f5. This scores evenly for Black, while the classic
...Nc6 shows a fairly significant White plus.} 4.Bb5+ {White seems to be mixing
and matching her variations, now developing the bishop to b5 as if it were the
Moscow Variation. This is less to the point here, as it does not have the same
impact on the fight for the center or support White's kingside thrust. Instead
Nf3 is by far the most played here, because why not?} 4...Bd7 5.Bc4 {White
indicates her desire to preserve the light-square bishop, but essentially this
is a free tempo for Black. For this to make sense, White would have to argue
that the Bd7 development is a net minus for Black. It does block the queen on
the d-file, and White now has more control over d5, but is the trade-off worth
it?} 5...Bg7 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.d3 {choosing to delay castling in favor of development,
with the idea of thrusting with the f-pawn.} 7...e6 {this leads to standard-type
play in the center. Objectively this is not bad for Black, but it is something
of a concession to allow White to easily pursue the typical plans here.} ( 
7...Na5 $5 {is an alternate way to play that puts more pressure on White to
prove her setup is good. For example} 8.f5 $2 {can now be met with} 8...Nxc4

the game. Black chooses an aggressive-looking continuation, but it results in a
White plus.} 8...Nd4 ( 8...gxf5 $5 {scores the best in practical terms, although
with a low number of games played.} ) 9.fxe6 {correctly exchanging the center
pawn.} 9...fxe6 $6 {Black chooses to maintain an equal number of central pawns,
but opens the f-file, making White's developmental lead more relevant.} 10.O-O 
Qb6 $6 {Black is clearly still thinking offense, when defense is more required
by the position. The queen move allows the idea of castling queenside, but this
would still leave the kingside and center weakened, and Black never in fact
manages to castle.} 11.Ng5 $16 {White has a pleasant choice of how to continue.
The text move hits e6 and f7 and unleashes the Rf1.} ( 11.Nxd4 {also results in
an advantage, for example} 11...Bxd4+ 12.Kh1 Nf6 13.Ne2 Be5 14.Nf4 $18 {White is
effectively targeting Black's weaknesses, while Black has no counterplay.} )

no good options.} 12...Nxe2+ ( 12...d5 $5 {is what the engine assesses is the
best chance for Black.} 13.exd5 exd5 14.Nxd4 O-O-O {and now White can choose
between Bb5 and Nf7 to maintain the advantage.} ) 13.Qxe2 e5 {trying to lock the
center, but this also decisively boosts White's light-square control.} 14.a4 
$18 {this looks a little random, after all the action on the e- and f-files, but
in fact it appears to be the most effective follow-up. Black will not have any
safety on the queenside either, with the Qb6 exposed to harrassment.} 14...Ke7 
{castling is now a distant dream. The text move covers the weak e6 square and
connects the rooks.} 15.a5 Qc7 16.b4 {further opening lines and keeping the
initiative, with what would only be a temporary pawn sacrifice.} 16...Raf8 ( 
16...cxb4 17.Bd2 $18 ) 17.bxc5 dxc5 18.d4 {White is in a hurry to further open
things up, but perhaps could have prepared the idea better.} ( 18.Nf3 {the
knight is no longer as effective on g5, so repositioning it first makes sense.} 
) 18...h6 {Black seizes the chance to gain a tempo on the knight and at least
temporarily win a pawn.} 19.Nf3 exd4 20.Nh4 $6 {here White gets distracted with
more knight moves, rather than pressing on in the now wide-open center. However
Black, under pressure, does not find the best active defense.} ( 20.e5 {would be
the direct approach.} ) ( 20.Bd2 {would develop White's last piece and connect
the rooks.} ) 20...Be8 $2 {the obvious defensive move to protect g6, but it
cannot save Black.} ( 20...Ng4 {is the best try, according to the engine. The
mate threat on h2 makes life much more difficult for White, who wins the
exchange but sees Black counterattack immediately, regaining material.}

Black's bishop.} 24.Qxd3 Bd4+ 25.Kh1 {and now Black has to find} 25...Ne5 (

Qb4.} ) 21.Bf4 $1 {White's last piece gets into the battle, with a vengeance.
The two bishops criss-cross Bthe center with nothing to stop them, while Black's
centralized king position without a pawn shield makes it obvious White is
winning.} 21...Qd7 22.Bb8 ( 22.Rab1 $5 {bringing another piece into the attack
first.} ) 22...Nh5 23.Bxa7 {the point of course is not the a-pawn itself, but
the threat to the c5 pawn.} 23...Qd6 24.Rab1 {bringing into play major threats
on the b-file.} 24...Rxf1+ 25.Qxf1 Be5 {now this threat to the h2 pawn is not
enough to distract White.} 26.Rxb7+ Kd8 27.Nf3 {getting the knight back into
play, guarding h2 and attacking the Be5.} 27...Rf8 28.Bb6+ {this is a strong
move but not a prudent one.} ( 28.Qb1 {would be useful in controlling the
b-file, as well as more importantly getting the queen off the file with the
rook, thereby eliminating what becomes a tactical possibility for Black.} )

Rc7+, but...} 29.Ba6 $2 {without an immediate threat, this allows Black to
execute the following tactic, based on the Nf3 pin.} 29...Bxh2+ $1 30.Nxh2

objectively should end in a draw by perpetual, which both side have (Ra7+ for
White). However, the fight continues. How does White, whose king is now quite
open as well, manage to emerge victorious?} 33.c3 {White starts by taking away
the d4 square, which is the obvious way for the Black queen to penetrate.}

for recovering the bishop.} 39.Kf2 Kxa6 40.c4 Kxa5 41.Bxc5 {the engine rates
this with only a slight plus to White, yet the positional imbalances would seem
to make it somewhat easier for White to play, given that the d-pawn is blockaded
while the passed e- and c-pawns are not.} 41...h5 42.Ke3 {this does not actually
threaten the d-pawn yet, since Black can use the fork trick on f4 to exchange it
for White's g-pawn.} 42...Ka4 $6 {this move seems to be the culprit for Black's
subsequent problems, as she puts her king too far from the action.} ( 42...Be6

restrain Black's pawns and prevent the fork trick on f4, while also clearing the
way on the c-file for the pawn.} 43...Nc1 44.Nf3 {the blockade is no longer
needed and the knight gets into the action.} 44...Be6 {a little too late now.}

mobilize counterplay with her pawn duo.} 48.Be7 {nothing looks good as an option
now for Black.} 48...g4 49.Kd4 ( 49.Kc3 {would maintain dominance over the Black
knight.} ) 49...Nb3+ 50.Kc3 Nc1 51.Nd3 $6 {a strange decision, to allow a pure
opposite-colored bishop ending, which is by far a better possibility to draw for
Black.} 51...Nxd3 52.Kxd3 Ka5 ( 52...g3 $5 ) 53.Kd4 Kb6 {now Black's king is not
so badly placed.} 54.c5+ Kc6 55.g3 Ba2 {Black's strategy now should be to use
the bishop to protect the h-pawn and/or threaten the e-pawn if the White king
strays too far. White cannot break the blockade on the c-pawn.} 56.Ke3 Kd7

leading to a lost position.} ( 58...Kc6 ) 59.Kg5 $1 {Black apparently did not
believe White could make progress. However...} 59...Be8 60.Bf4 {Black is now in
zugzwang, as the bishop is overloaded protecting the h5 pawn and the c6 square.
The next king move is comparatively best, but still allows White a winning
advantage.} 60...Ke7 61.Kf5 $1 Bd7+ 62.Ke5 {in contrast with the previous
situation, White's king is now fully centralized and Black's king has been
forced back to the 7th rank away from the c-pawn, where it is also vulnerable to
further harassment by the bishop. White still has to defend the e-pawn with her
king, but finds the correct way to make progress.} 62...Bc6 63.Bg5+ Kd7 64.Kf5

king.} 64...Bb7 65.e5 Kc6 {this is meaningless, since White's bishop can protect

Slav"} 5.Nc3 e6 6.Nh4 Bg6 ( 6...Be4 {was played in the previously analyzed game
from this tournament. I prefer it because it is more active and normally forces
f2-f3.} ) 7.Be2 Be7 {this could be viewed as prematurely committing the bishop,
with ...Nbd7 being by far the most played here.} 8.Nxg6 hxg6 9.Qc2 {White scores
very well in the database from here, over 80 percent.} 9...Qc7 {taking advantage
of the open h-file to pressure h2, however this is easily frustrated by} 10.g3

final minor piece. Black has to decide on her strategy at this point, and
chooses something very unusual.} 11...g5 {Perhaps this was more of a waiting
move, to see what White would commit to first. Later the g-pawn actually becomes
useful when White allows Black too much leeway on the h-file.} ( 11...O-O

) ( 11...dxc4 {immediately, similar to what occurred in the previously analyzed
game, also looks good and perhaps more active for Black.} ) 12.O-O {this is safe
for the moment and not a bad choice, but White should watch out for ideas by
Black to be able to attack using the h-file, as in fact happens later.}

attempt to control the center, so Black's counter-thrust is more impactful.}

the ...c5 and ...Ne5 ideas.} 14...Nb6 {dominating d5 and protecting the c4 pawn.

probably simplest for equality.} 15.dxc6 $6 Qc8 $1 {while not yet winning, this

to h3.} 16.Bf3 $6 ( 16.g4 {was necessary, as the engine points out.} ) 16...Qh3

for the Qc2.} 18...Nfd7 $6 {this delays Black's attack too long and allows White
to insert a good defensive move. It also removes from the action a potentially
excellent attacking piece for Black. It does allow the Be7 to protect the g5
pawn, which perhaps was why it was played.} ( 18...Qxh2+ 19.Kf1 Qh3+ 20.Bg2 Qh5

itself and Black needs to cover the c4 pawn and central squares. White should
now be able to recover at least one of the pawns and can think about
counterplay, although she is still a little worse off.} 22.Rac1 $15 f6 {this

restriction idea, but White has better rooks than before.} 31.f3 $6 {the general
idea of breaking the bishop out is correct, but before White's 3 pawns were
successfully containing Black's 4 on the kingside. This exchange results in a
weak structure for White.} ( 31.Rd7 ) 31...gxf3 {immediately taking advantage of

afford to do other things first.} ( 31...Kg6 32.fxg4 b4 33.axb4 cxb4 34.Rd7 Bc5

move in the database, but not nearly as effective as ...Bg4 in countering
White's basic plans in this opening setup.} 5.b3 {this move is emblematic of the
Colle-Zukertort variation; however, it is normally played when Black has gone
...c5.} 5...Nbd7 6.Bb2 Bb4+ {played to provoke White's next move, but it is not
obligatory.} ( 6...Ne4 $5 {now Black could seize some space and play like a
Dutch Stonewall following ...f5. Taking the knight is not a great option for
White.} 7.Bxe4 dxe4 8.Ne5 Bb4+ 9.c3 Nxe5 10.dxe5 Qxd1+ 11.Kxd1 Be7 $10 ) 7.c3 (

bit contradictory, it actually appears best, as Black would simply lose a tempo
by moving the bishop back to b4.} 8...Ne4 {although this is a key idea for Black
in this formation, both the database and the engine indicate that it might be
better played earlier, on move 6. Now it moves an already-developed piece
twice.} 9.O-O {nowhere else to put the king, so might as well castle now.}

appear to be anything better.} ( 9...f5 {going for a Stonewall formation would
be the logical follow-up to ...Ne4. However, this scores poorly in the database
and is very committal.} ) 10.Ne5 ( 10.Nc3 $5 {scores even better in the database
and is a less committal option for White.} ) 10...f6 11.Nxd7 {probably best, so
as not to lose a tempo by retreating, although there is the trade-off of making
Black a little less cramped overall after the pieces are removed.} 11...Bxd7 
12.f3 {symmetrically kicking Black's knight now, which will be awkwardly
placed.} 12...Ng5 13.Nd2 {this appears to be an inferior square for the knight.
Going to c3 instead would indirectly restrain ...e5, due to cxd5, although there
are some tactics to think about.} ( 13.Nc3 $5 f5 ( 13...e5 $6 14.cxd5 exd4

queen) lift to the h-file and try for a perpetual check.} ) ) 14.Qd2 $14 {with
the idea of Ne2-f4 as a follow-up, also enabling play for the rooks.} ) 13...f5 
{If Black was planning to play this way, it seems like making this move earlier
would have been better, although it is not bad. The f6 pawn would instead seem
better placed to support play in the center, specifically the e-pawn lever.} ( 
13...e5 ) 14.Qe2 $10 {White has the problem of where to put her queen, as no
square is particularly good, and is somewhat cramped.} 14...Be8 {a classic idea
in the Stonewall formation. The bishop will do nicely one repositioned.} 15.e4

premature.} 15...Bh5 {the logical follow-up, although it might be better to
anticipate White's next.} ( 15...Bb4 $5 {immediately pressures the Nd2, which is
a key tactical point. White does not have time to simply kick it away.} 16.a3

piece liquidation ends up being even, but it helps White un-cramp her position.}

temporarily, and keep White a little more cramped.} ) 20.Qxd2 Nxd3 21.Qxd3 {now

for the light-squre bishop, but also putting the pawn farther from its support.}

the 2nd rank .} 23...Qh4 {committing the queen to the kingside. This move also
overprotects the f-pawn.} 24.Qf2 Qh6 {indicating Black wants to play for a win,
rather than exchange. However, she does not have any real threats and the queen
is not very effective on h6, so White could take advantage of this.} 25.cxd5 (

square.} ) 25...exd5 {Black continues to try to unbalance the game in seeking a
win, but again White could take even more advantage. However, the engine move
may not have even been contemplated, since it detaches the e-pawn from its
support.} ( 25...cxd5 26.Rac1 Rfc8 $10 ) 26.Bc1 {a passive place for the bishop,
but equal.} ( 26.e6 $1 {the idea is that the pawn can get to e7 and cannot be
dislodged, putting Black under pressure and giving White a measurable
advantage.For example} 26...Bf5 27.e7 Rf6 28.Rfe1 Re8 29.Ba3 $16 {with the idea
of Re5 and also the potential for play on the queenside with a4-a5 and Bc5.} ) 
( 26.Ba3 {again is a good idea, although after ...Rfe8 Black is still all
right.} ) 26...Rae8 {restraining the e-pawn.} 27.a5 {this is less effective with
the bishop on c1 instead of a3.} 27...Bd3 {while the position is equal, Black
again has some initiative due to White's passivity.} 28.Rg1 Qh5 {the point here
is that h6 is cleared for a rook lift.} 29.Re1 {White does not appear to have
any ideas for progress, since the rook of course could have come to e1 the prior
move.} 29...Re6 30.Ra2 Rf5 {Black continues with piece play. However, we now
have a Dutch-looking structure in which the natural move would be to grab space
on the kingside.} ( 30...g5 $5 ) 31.Rd2 Bb5 {although Black's pieces are clearly
more active, there is still no way to make progress. White can play for a
fortress by simply moving her rook to c2, for example.} 32.Qg1 $6 {this actually
weakens White's defensive structure, by making the queen a potential target and
giving up control of the e1-h4 diagonal.} 32...Qf7 33.Rf2 Rg6 {choosing to line
up against the queen on the g-file rather than the king on the h-file. However,
Black does not have much in the way of follow-up threats.} ( 33...Rh5 $5 {would
appear to be a more consistent with the queen retreat, allowing for ...Rh4 as a
follow-up while pressuring the h-file, for example by putting the queen back on
h5.} ) 34.h3 Kf8 {this doesn't seem like a necessary idea, but then again there
is no evident way to make progress.} 35.Ba3+ Ke8 36.Rd2 $2 {White further cramps
her position and now Black is able to obtain a winning advantage by rearranging
her own pieces for a kingside attack.} ( 36.e6 $5 {again the Dragon engine spots
this idea, which seems counter-intuitive.} 36...Rxe6 {the pawn sacrifice is good
for dynamic equality, as Black having brought her king to the center made it a
target along the e-file. For example} 37.Rc2 Rf6 38.Rcc1 $10 {preparing to
reload on the e-file after an exchange of rooks} ) ( 36.Ra1 {looks safe and
allows for the the queen to become more active via Qc1 and then transferring to
c5.} ) 36...Qe6 {this blocks the e-pawn and lines up on h3.} 37.Qh2 {White
continues with her static defense.} 37...Rg3 $1 {now there is nothing White can
do to stop Black's buildup.} 38.Bc1 Rh5 39.Ra2 g5 {Black finally gets the g-pawn
into the action.} 40.Bd2 Bd3 {following the rule of bringing all the pieces into
the attack.} 41.a6 {a sacrificial distraction. Black would do best to not
retreat the bishop and continue the attack, but is still winning after snatching
the pawn.} 41...Bxa6 ( 41...b6 {and now ...Bf5 is threatened, with White having
no counterplay.} ) 42.Rc1 {clearing e1 for the bishop. Black could simply
proceed with taking on h3 now, although the text move is still fine.} 42...Qf5 
( 42...Rgxh3 43.gxh3 Rxh3 44.Bb4 Rxh2+ 45.Rxh2 Qf5 $19 {Black is winning handily
with the extra pawns, but perhaps she did not want to deal with the queen versus
two rooks dynamics.} ) 43.Be1 Rgxh3 44.gxh3 Rxh3 45.Rxa6 {a desperate bid for
counterplay by opening the c-file.} 45...Rxh2+ 46.Kxh2 bxa6 47.Rxc6 $19 {at the
end of the sequence Black is materially up by a winning amount, but still has
some cleaning up to do. The power of the queen is nicely demonstrated.}

pawn shield for White.} ) 48.Kg2 Qxd4 {Black takes her time and keeps the win in
hand, rather than worrying about playing the absolute best move. This is an
excellent strategy in the endgame.} 49.e6 Qb2+ 50.Bf2 d4 {passed pawns must be
pushed! This also completely cuts off the Bf2 from the action, prompting White
to in effect exchange the e- and d-pawns, which also results in the rest of the
queenside pawns disappearing. The simplification does not help White, however.}

Black argues that it is not by playing the text move.} 7. f3 Bg6 8. Qb3 Qc7 9. Bd2 Be7 10. g3 {now White varies from following the round 3 game of Lee, which featured queenside castling.} dxc4 {this is one of the top Dragon 3.2 engine choices, but is relatively little played and scores poorly (25 percent) in the database. Black prefers to dissolve the center and rely on her solid structure to deter White aggression. Meanwhile, White gets a space advantage.} 11.

Nxf8 Rxf8 {using a standard "points" method of counting material, White is the equivalent of a pawn up.

1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nf6 5. Nxf6+ exf6 {the Tartakower variation, which has been rehabilitated in the last few years.} 6. c3 {by far the most played here. White shores up d4 before further development, but can afford the time to do so.} Bf5 {although this is the second most-played move in the database, it is far below ...Bd6 in popularity.} (6... Bd6 7. Bd3 O-O 8. Qc2 Re8+ 9. Ne2 h5 {is the line that is most responsible for reviving the variation.}) 7. Bc4 {this placement of the bishop, while aggressive-looking, is usually not a threat to Black in the Caro-Kann. In this variation, White does not have a knight developed yet and both g5 and e5 - normally good possibilities for an outpost - are covered by the doubled f-pawn, which therefore proves useful.} Bd6 8. Qe2+ {White signals a willingness to enter a queenless middlegame here, as Black's next move is clearly best.} Qe7 9. Nf3 Nd7 {Black is willing to maintain the tension and see where White takes things.} 10. Qxe7+ Kxe7 $5 {Black's intent is to "castle by hand", choosing to maintain the bishop on the move advantageous b8-h2 diagonal.} 11. O-O Rhe8 12. Nh4 Be6 {naturally an exchange on e6 would un-double Black's pawns, a good outcome.} 13. Bd3 g6 {Black now has a very solid pawn lineup on the 6th rank and White has no real weaknesses to target.} 14. Re1 Kf8 $11 15. c4 {gaining a bit of space and bringing up the future possibility of d4-d5. However, this goes against the original idea of playing c2-c3, which was to keep d4 from becoming a Black target. This is now exactly what happens.} Rad8 {Black does not have any major weaknesses to target either, but centralizing the rook and putting it opposite the currently undefended d-pawn is a good idea in general.} 16. Bd2 {while not bad, this development of the bishop is a little slow and without much point to it. Bringing the knight back from its exile on h4 might make more sense.} Be7 {clearing one piece from the d-file, in front of the Rd8.} 17. Ba5 Nb6 {now the knight is actually doing something useful, and of course an exchange on b6 would be both materially and positionally desirable for Black.} 18. Nf3 (18. Bxb6 axb6 19. Nf3 {and Black can choose between ...f5, ...Bc5 or ...Bg4 to win a pawn.}) 18... Rd7 {clearing d8 to double rooks, as well as getting out of the pin.} 19. b3 {c4 must be protected now that the Nb6 is "alive" again.} Bg4 {The correct positional idea. White's bishop is very limited, so exchange it for White's more flexible knight, which is also a key defender of d4.} 20. Bc3 {covering the d-pawn.} Bxf3 21. gxf3 $15 {White's kingside structure is now ugly enough to warrant giving Black a slight plus.} Red8 {doubling rooks, per the idea on move 18.} 22. b4 $2 {whoops! White loses patience and advances another pawn prematurely.} (22. Rad1 {would activate the other rook and prepare to reinforce the d-file.}) 22... Na4 {This would seem to be the obvious response, driving away the bishop from the defense of the d-pawn, after which Black can scoop it up.} 23. Rxe7 $2 (23. Bd2 Rxd4 24. Bh6+ Ke8 25. Bf1 {it's possible that Eswaran calcuated this out and just saw a torturous endgame loss in her future, so she decided to try and complicate things at the board.}) 23... Rxe7 24. Be1 Rxd4 $19 25. Bf1 {It's hard to see any hope for White here, as the two bishops simply cannot match up against the two rooks. White can however use the power of the two bishops to hold off her opponent for a while.} Kg7 {a safe move, defending the otherwise hanging f-pawn. This also helps prepare the withdrawal of the Na4, which is currently preventing Bc3.} 26. Rb1 Nb6 27. Rc1 Nd7 {it takes a while to reposition the knight, but White cannot do anything substantial in the meantime.} 28. Bc3 Rf4 29. Kg2 Ne5 30. Be2 g5 31. Bd2 Ng6 $1 {these kinds of moves help distinguish masters from other players, who might simply reflexively move the rook away. Here, Yu gets more from the position.} 32. Be3 (32. Bxf4 $2 Nxf4+ 33. Kf1 Rxe2) 32... Rh4 {Black could still ignore the capture on f4, but Yu has something different in mind, wanting to create pressure down the h-file.} 33. Bf1 {now Bxa7 is threatened, with the bishop no longer hanging.} b6 34. Rd1 Rh6 (34... Ne5 $5 {is a more normal-looking move that improves the knight's range, threatening c4 as well.}) 35. Kg3 Nh4 {a strong move that takes advantage of the White king's advance, cutting off its retreat to g2 while pressuring f3 and threatening ...Nf5.} 36. Bh3 {this allows the following tactic} Nxf3 {the Bh3 hangs if the king recaptures on f3.} 37. a4 Rh4 {the rook reactivates itself to great effect. It's unclear why White continues on at this point, although the idea of a queenside pawn advance supported by her bishops perhaps looked like a desperate possibility.} 38. c5 Ne5 (38... bxc5 {might be more straightforward, as after} 39. Bxc5 Re1 40. Rxe1 Nxe1 41. Bxa7 Rxb4 {and Black is winning.}) 39. Bd4 Re8 {this subtle move will allow the rook to go to the d-file in some variations.} 40. b5 {still hoping for a breakthrough.} cxb5 {this is certainly good enough to win.} (40... Rd8 $1 {is actually an excellent idea, pinning the bishop and a natural follow-up to the previous move.}) 41. axb5 bxc5 42. Bxc5 Rc4 43. Be3 Rb4 {White's queenside ambitions are no more, but the b-pawn still holds out a sliver of hope.} 44. Bf1 Rg4+ 45. Kh3 h5 (45... f5 {is also possible here, getting some more out of the extra f-pawn.}) 46. Be2 Rh4+ 47. Kg3 Ng4 {cleverly forcing an advantageous trade.} 48. Bxg4 Rxg4+ 49. Kf3 Re7 {a safe move - why rush things?} 50. Rd6 Re5 51. Bd4 Rf4+ 52. Kg2 Rxb5 {now the position is certainly resignable, but Eswaran plays on.} 53. Bxa7 Rg4+ 54. Kh3 Rb3+ 55.

Interestingly, Bb5 is now much more popular.} O-O 8. a3 {keeping the Black knight out of b4. However, this is slow and scores worse in the database than Bb5 (again) or developing immediately with Nbd2.} b6 {Black has to prepare the development of her light-square bishop.} 9. Nbd2 Bb7 10. Ne5 {the classic idea, posting up the knight on e5 and then gaining space on the kingside for an attack. White would welcome an exchange on e5, gaining space and kicking the Nf6 away with an occupying pawn.} Ne7 {this move does multiple things, increasing Black's control of e4 by getting out of the way of the Bb7, and preparing to go to f5 later.} 11. f4 {we now have a very Stonewall-like structure for White, with the difference of a pawn on a3 instead of c3.} Ne4 {for similar reasons as above, Black would welcome an exchange of the knight on e4.} 12. Qe2 {normally the best place for the queen, protecting the weak e3 pawn, forming a battery on the f1-a6 diagonal, connecting the rooks, and giving the option later of perhaps moving along the 2nd rank.} Rc8 {Black now has a classically solid position, with an obvious plan of expanding on the queenside and down the c-file.} 13. dxc5 {this scores well practically, but only if Black does not take with the knight.} (13.

By this point, White's attempt at an attacking setup has been rebuffed, but Black is unable to target any weak points either.} a5 20.

O-O {White has staked out a presence in the center with d4, but waits before committing further with c4.} Ne4 $5 {this is a very rare idea and seems premature. In a symmetrical opening setup, the Black player moving the same piece twice will by definition lose time, so needs to have a specific follow-up idea that makes it worthwhile. Here there do not seem to be enough threats generated by the move to compensate for the time loss.} 6. c4 {scored by Dragon 3.2 as best.

Bg4 $6 {here with h3 White could either force a trade of minor pieces, thereby winning the two bishops, or a bishop retreat, gaining additional time.

Bd5 {perhaps played with the idea of restraining the ...b4 advance. However, the bishop is a little awkwardly placed here and Black can continue with her knight maneuver.} Ne6 21.

An h-pawn advance against a fianchettoed bishop position is a standard theme, especially when there is no knight protecting it.} Bf8 {looking to exchange off one of the bishop pair.} 26. h5 {White persists with her idea of assaulting the kingside pawn shield.} Bxc5 27. dxc5 {White's queenside pawn structure is shattered, but the increased kingside attacking potential is sufficient compensation.} Ne8 $2 {the general idea of swinging the knight back to the defense is principled, but this avenue does not work.} (27... Nd5 $1 $11) 28. c6 $18 {White chooses to keep the pawn by advancing it into protection; despite being behind Black's lines, it cannot effectively be targeted.} (28. hxg6 {immediately was also possible.}) 28... Qc7 {pressuring the e5 pawn, without which White has no attack.} 29. Qf4 {consolidating the advantage by guarding the pawn and positioning the queen to penetrate on the dark squares. The rook lift threat Rb1-d1-d7 is now quite powerful, given the weakness of f7; meanwhile, Black still has to blockade the c-pawn.} Ng7 30. hxg6 (30. h6 $1 {is also possible as the knight is driven away, with White's pressure resulting in material gain.

Black cannot leave d8 unprotected.} Rxd7 {Black chooses to get rid of the advanced passed pawn and simplify into a (still-losing) rook vs. minor piece endgame. However her pawns are too weak and the knight is outmatched by White's rook.} 36. Bxd7 Qxd7 37. Rxa5 Qd1+ 38. Kh2 Qd5 39. Ra7 {again a rook on the 7th rank dominates.} Qf3 40. Qd8+ Qf8 41.

1. Nf3 d5 2. e3 {this is now known as the Keymer Variation and flexibly can lead to various setups.} Nf6 3. b3 {getting into Nimzo-Larsen territory...sort of.} Bf5 {heading for a reverse London setup, although technically this way of development for Black was advocated by Lasker a long time before the London became popular.} 4. Bb2 e6 5. Be2 {White has nowhere else useful to put the bishop, so an easy choice.} h6 6. O-O Bd6 7. Ne5 {c4 is most commonly played here, but has a dismal result in the database (24 percent). The text move leads to an interesting reverse Dutch setup.} O-O 8. f4 Nbd7 9. d3 {White prudently first takes control of e4 in a reverse Classical Dutch arrangement.} Bh7 {getting the bishop out of the potential future line of fire, for example with e4 or g4 pawn advances.} 10. Nd2 Bc5 {targeting the weak e3 square, so White's next is logical.} 11. d4 Be7 12. Bd3 {now White has a position very similar to the Colle-Zukertort (without a pawn on a3) or the Stonewall (without a pawn on c3).} c5 13. Qf3 {e2 is normally a better square for the queen. On f3 it blocks both the knights and the Rf1 from potentially using the square.} Qa5 {hitting the now-undefended Nd2, another drawback of the previous move.} 14. Rad1 Bxd3 (14... Qxa2 {is possible but no more advantageous for Black.} 15. Bxh7+ Kxh7 16. Nd3 {protecting the Bb2 and now threatening to trap the queen.} Qa5 17. g4 $11 {and White has compensation in kingside space and pressure for the a-pawn.}) 15. Nxd3 Rac8 {of course ...Qxa2?? is no longer possible, due to Ra1 trapping the queen.} 16. dxc5 {White makes a good choice to liquidate her center, which also frees up the long diagonal for the Bb2.} Bxc5 17. Nxc5 (17. c4 $5 {immediately also looks good.}) 17... Rxc5 18. c4 {finally challenging Black directly in the center.} b5 {this feels a little artificial, and White is able to respond effectively.} (18... Qxa2 {is now possible again, with similar ideas as in the above variation.} 19. Bd4 Rc7 20. cxd5 exd5 21. g4 $11) 19. a3 {with the obvious threat of the b4 pawn fork.} Rc6 (19... b4 $6 {would physically prevent White from gaining more space, but White's structure is better after} 20. a4 $16 {and ideas of e4, g4 and Bd4 coming into play.}) 20. b4 Qa4 {although this sidelines Black's queen, it is surprisingly the only move which maintains equality.} 21. cxd5 exd5 {best, but now Black's central pawn is isolated.} (21... Nxd5 $6 22. e4 $1 $16 {and White now dominates the center, with strong prospects for a kingside attack.}) 22. e4 Qc2 {the point behind Black's 20th move, allowing the queen to strive for counterplay deep in White's position. Both the Bb2 and e4 are targeted.} 23. exd5 {liquidating the threat to the pawn with gain of tempo on the rook.} Rd6 {necessary to regain the pawn. The engine evaluation is equal, but it's clear that White has the easier game.} 24. Bxf6 Nxf6 25. Nb3 {eyeing the c5 and d4 squares next.} Re8 $2 {too ambitious, given White's next move. A number of other moves were fine here, including ...Qe4 or doubling rooks on the d-file.} 26. Nd4 $1 {now this permanently wins White a pawn with the fork on b5, or after Black's next allows for even stronger posting of the knight.} Qc4 $6 27. Nf5 {forking the Rd6 and g7, which after Qg3 is a major problem for Black. Eswaran opts to lose the exchange instead.} Rxd5 28. Ne3 Rxe3 29. Qxe3 $18 {Black has no compensation for the lost material and White's pieces are placed excellently.} a6 30. Rxd5 {following the rule to simplify down when winning.} Qxd5 31. h3 {safety first, evidently White was thinking, creating another square for her king.} Ne4 32. f5 {clearing the f4 square and threatening to advance further once the knight leaves e4.} (32. Kh2 $5 {tucking the king away and guarding g3 again.}) 32... Nf6 {physically blocking the f-pawn, with nothing really better.} 33. Qf3 Qd4+ 34. Kh2 Ne4 {Black seems to be out of ideas, so White logically pins the knight against the queen.} 35. Qf4 Qd5 {breaking the pin, but lacking anything else to do.} 36. Rc1 (36. Re1 $5 {looking to go to the 7th rank is another good alternative.}) 36... Nd6 {Black's pieces are too exposed to the Q+R combo, but she refuses to give up just yet.} 37. Rc5 Qd3 38. f6 {with the assault on the king position on top of everything else, the position is now resignable for Black.} g5 39. Qe5 g4 40. hxg4 {winning with calmness.} Qe4 41. Qxd6 Kh7 42. Rc8 Qxg4 43. Qd3+ 1-0

O-O Be7 9. a3 {in keeping with the Hedgehog theme.} O-O 10. Re1 (10. c4 $5 {would strike back in the center and reduce White's level of passivity.}) 10...

Qe2 {White seems determined to "turtle up" with all her pieces.} Rfe8 13. g3 {this move is not really in keeping with the idea of the original e3/Be2 development, but if White is not worried about things like tempi or challenging the center, then it is at least consistent with her strategic approach.} Bg4 {provoking White's next.} (13... e5 $5 {Black could also immediately seize more space with her well-supported central pawn.}) 14. h3 Bh5 15. Bg2 e5 $15 {Black has no weaknesses and a space advantage in the center.} 16. g4 Bg6 17. e4 {White now challenges for the first time in the center. Black then chooses to lock it, reducing her dynamic possibilities.} d4 {this makes the position simpler to play and certainly helps lock out the Bb2. However, Black could have done more with a mobile center and keeping the tension.} 18. Nf1 {with a closed center, White can return to leisurely maneuvering.} Nf8 19. Bc1 {the bishop currently has no future on the long diagonal. White can now think about further supporting a g4-g5 advance.} Ne6 20. Ng3 Nd7 {pre-emptively getting away from a pawn attack and opening up the Be7 on the diagonal.} 21. h4 {White's plan is very clear by now, to expand with all available pawns and pieces on the kingside.} c5 {not a bad move, but real counterplay on the queenside is far away, with all the action on the kingside.} (21... f6 $5 {would directly counter White's plan.}) 22. Bh3 Nf4 23. Qf1 {White at this point would be fine with a minor piece exchange on h3, thereby putting the queen on a more effective square.} (23. Bxf4 $5 {exchanging the bad bishop for good knight looks like a good deal for White.}) 23... b5 {continuing the idea of queenside counterplay through pawn advancement.} 24. Nf5 Bf8 (24... Nxh3+ 25. Qxh3 Bf8 {the engine evaluates as an improved version of the idea for Black.}) 25. g5 {this appears premature, as Black could lock things up and then proceed on the queenside.} h5 (25... Nxh3+ 26. Qxh3 h5) 26. Ng3 (26. Bxf4 $11 {is still best here, exchanging off the bad bishop.}) 26... Nxh3+ $1 {now Black goes for this idea, with admittedly more impact than it might have had before.} 27.

The 2-1 connected queenside majority is Black's potential winning formula.} 32. Ne1 {Other moves would have been more active, such as Bb4 or Qe2.} Nc5 $19 {Black has mobilized her pieces and looks ready to press forward on the queenside.} 33. Rb4 Qa6 34. Qe2 Rb8 {this overprotects the b-pawn, but allows White's next.} (34... Na4 $1 {is recommended by the engine, gaining a tempo on the Rb4 and offering up the h-pawn as a sacrifice with powerful compensation.} 35. Rb3 Rc8 {and now} 36.

Rb3 {This is evaluated by the engine as equal, perhaps with a slight advantage to White. Clearly not what Black was looking for earlier. The protected passed d-pawn looks strong, but White has an effective blockade and her pieces will be active enough to fend off any threats.} Ne6 45. Nd3 Nc5 46. Nxc5 Bxc5 47.
