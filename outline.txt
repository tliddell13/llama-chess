Core Research Questions:

How can LLMs learn to decompose complex goals (win game) into manageable sub-goals (control center, develop pieces)?
When should the LLM rely on symbolic reasoning vs. learned patterns?
Can sub-goal structures transfer to other domains beyond chess?

Hierarchical Planning Structure:
Strategic Level: "Win the game" (Obviously)
├── Tactical Level: "Control the center", "King safety", "Piece activity"  
    ├── Operational Level: "Develop knight", "Castle kingside"
        ├── Move Level: "Nf3", "O-O"

Phase 1
- Train 3B on basic move prediction (PGN format)
- Establish chess playing baseline
- Implement chess engine integration for legal move validation

Phase 2
- Create training data with hand-crafted sub-goal labels
- Train model to predict both moves AND current sub-goal
- Evaluate sub-goal prediction accuracy

Phase 3 
- Implement multi-level goal decomposition
- Train model to generate sub-goal sequences
- Test planning coherence over longer games

Phase 4
- Add symbolic queries (position evaluation, tactical checks)
- Train model when to use symbolic vs neural reasoning
- Measure hybrid performance vs pure approaches

Evaluation Framework:
Chess strength (ELO estimation)
Sub-goal completion rates
Planning horizon effectiveness
Symbolic tool usage appropriateness
